In general, oak species are preferred-on the other hand some other groups of plants are avoided on account of the presence of toxic substances. These unfavoured hosts are, for example, most of the Papilionaceae, like locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). We compared survival rate and development of two populations of different origin with long-term habituation to oak and locust, respectively. Larvae from the population habituated to oak proved unable to develop on locust food. There must be a lack of detoxification systems to modify the toxic alcaloids and flavenoids produced by Robinia pseudoacacia. On the other hand, larvae isolated from an locust stand were able to feed on oak leaves without problems in larval development or eclosion of adults. Gypsy moth larvae specialized on locust as host showed increased mortality (up to 27%) in the early larval instars, but the surviving animals, especially female individuals, reached significantly higher pupal weights and showed better fecundity: 40% higher egg numbers/egg mass compared to those feeding on oak. These results indicate that the gypsy moth population originating from the locust forest had achieved a high level of metabolic adaptation to this host plant and formed a 'biotype' of Lymantria dispar with optimal reproductive conditions in this special habitat.",

[Method] PCR amplification and microarray hybridization were used to detect 15 symptomatic plants probablyinfected with phytoplasma and asymptomatic plants as healthy controls collected from different regions in China. [Result] Phytoplasma 16S rDNA were detected in 13 of 15 symptomatic plants but not in all the healthy controls. Thirteen phytoplasmas were classified into 16Sr I, 16Sr II, 16Sr V and 16Sr XIX groups. Among 17 tested probes, the universal probe designated Pp-502 could be used to detect all phytoplasmas associated with plant disease. The specific probe designated Pp I-465 for 16Sr I group could be used to detect four phytoplasma strains of 16Sr I group associated with paulownia witches' -broom, chinaberry witches ' -broom, mulberry dwarf and lettuce yellows. The probe Pp II-629 for 16Sr II could be used to detect three phytoplasma strains 16Sr II group associated with peanut witches' -broom, sweet potato witches' -broom and cleome witches' -broom. Three phytoplasma strains of 16Sr V associated with jujube witches ' -broom, cherry lethal yellows and Bischofia polycarpa witches broom and chestnut yellows crinkle phytoplasma of 16Sr XIX could also be detected by specific probes, but they showed obvious.cross hybridization with other group probes. Compared with PCR amplification, the sensitivity of microarray to detect phytoplasma in plant increased by 1000-fold. Phytoplasmas of 16SrI and 16SrV group respectively were detected in periwinkle with symptoms of phyllody and witches' -broom collected from Fujian province and Robinia hispida with symptom of witches ' -broom collected from Henan province. While no phytoplasma was detected in peony with symptom of yellowing collected from Beijing and willow with symptom of witches' broom collected from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. [Conclusion] The oligonucleotide microarray on the platform of ArrayTube could be used as a method to investigate phytoplasmas in China, and could provide a sound basis for the phytoplasma identification and classification.",

[Method] PCR amplification and microarray hybridization were used to detect 15 symptomatic plants probablyinfected with phytoplasma and asymptomatic plants as healthy controls collected from different regions in China. [Result] Phytoplasma 16S rDNA were detected in 13 of 15 symptomatic plants but not in all the healthy controls. Thirteen phytoplasmas were classified into 16Sr I, 16Sr II, 16Sr V and 16Sr XIX groups. Among 17 tested probes, the universal probe designated Pp-502 could be used to detect all phytoplasmas associated with plant disease. The specific probe designated Pp I-465 for 16Sr I group could be used to detect four phytoplasma strains of 16Sr I group associated with paulownia witches' -broom, chinaberry witches ' -broom, mulberry dwarf and lettuce yellows. The probe Pp II-629 for 16Sr II could be used to detect three phytoplasma strains 16Sr II group associated with peanut witches' -broom, sweet potato witches' -broom and cleome witches' -broom. Three phytoplasma strains of 16Sr V associated with jujube witches ' -broom, cherry lethal yellows and Bischofia polycarpa witches broom and chestnut yellows crinkle phytoplasma of 16Sr XIX could also be detected by specific probes, but they showed obvious.cross hybridization with other group probes. Compared with PCR amplification, the sensitivity of microarray to detect phytoplasma in plant increased by 1000-fold. Phytoplasmas of 16SrI and 16SrV group respectively were detected in periwinkle with symptoms of phyllody and witches' -broom collected from Fujian province and Robinia hispida with symptom of witches ' -broom collected from Henan province. While no phytoplasma was detected in peony with symptom of yellowing collected from Beijing and willow with symptom of witches' broom collected from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. [Conclusion] The oligonucleotide microarray on the platform of ArrayTube could be used as a method to investigate phytoplasmas in China, and could provide a sound basis for the phytoplasma identification and classification."

Intraspecific variation in dietary breadth can influence important ecological and evolutionary processes, yet the mechanisms generating this variation are usually unknown. Maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts frequently infect insect herbivores, and many have been shown to mediate key ecological interactions. For polyphagous herbivores, infection with particular symbionts is often strongly correlated with feeding on particular plant species, suggesting that facultative symbionts might directly determine herbivore food plant specificity. However, previous tests of this hypothesis have returned inconsistent results, providing little empirical support for a causal relationship between facultative symbiont infection and dietary breadth. 2. Here, we investigate whether heritable facultative symbionts mediate dietary breadth in the polyphagous aphid, Aphis craccivora. We first determined that asexual clones of the aphid differ dramatically in performance across two leguminous food plants, locust and alfalfa, and could be considered biotypes with distinct ecological characteristics. The heritable symbiont Arsenophonus is strongly associated with locust-origin aphids. 3. We created experimental lines that share aphid genotypes but differed with respect to Arsenophonus infection status, and compared performance across three food plant species. Naturally Arsenophonus-infected clones performed 2-4x better on locust and up to 75% worse on two alternate plant species than uninfected controls, clearly demonstrating that Arsenophonus promotes specialization on locust. In both laboratory and field experiments, uninfected locust- and alfalfa-origin clones exhibited similar and modest performance on locust, indicating that the locust-associated biotype' would not exist without Arsenophonus. 4. We also hypothesized that moving Arsenophonus, via transinfection, to an alfalfa-origin lineage would improve performance on locust and serve to expand dietary breadth. Indeed, transinfection doubled aphid performance on locust and halved aphid performance on alfalfa. However, because this aphid lineage naturally performs better on alfalfa, the transinfected symbiont functionally equalized aphid performance between locust and alfalfa, making the alfalfa biotype more generalized. Thus, the same symbiont can either reduce or expand dietary breadth, depending on host genotype. 5. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that symbiont gain or loss can instantaneously and substantially change the topology of food plant use in a polyphagous insect, modifying diet in ways that potentially influence the insect's ecological niche, evolutionary trajectory and pest status.",

Corydalis favula plants were sparsely dispersed, averaging 1.4 plants/m(2) and 1.1% cover in all plots. Over 95% of C. favula plants produced flowers, and 89% produced seeds.

Over 11% of plants were browsed by deer, foliage on 3.4% of plants showed insect feeding damage, and 3.7% of capsules showed external attack. Inside capsules, insect attack was more frequent, averaging 11%. The six stands where C. favula was monitored were relatively similar: young, second growth, disturbed forests, dominated by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and subdominated by black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.). Tree density ranged from approximately 750-1250 trees/ha, and dead trees were common, accounting for an additional 28% of all trees > 10 cm dbh. Corydalis favula presence was associated with shorter groundlayer vegetation (25 cm vs 29 cm) and lower groundlayer cover (96% vs 107%), and abundance was significantly higher in both quadrats and plots with low graminoid cover and high annual and biennial cover.

They are easy distinguished from the mines caused by Parectopa robiniella: the mines of Phyllonorycter are on the leaf underside and are oval shaped and the mines caused by the last four instars of the Parectopa larvae are on the leaf upperside and are ramified. The moth overwinter. The first mines appear in June. The miner has 4-5 generations. The intensity of attack is fastly increasing during the year.

Leafminers are very successfull invaders and they build up their populations soon after establishment in an new area. Invaders escape from their native parasitoids and have competitive advantage over native species in new area. Native parasitoids adapt to new host and new parasitoid assemblages are established. Croatia has rich native leafminer fauna with recently added alien and invasive species. Phyllonorycter roboris, Phyllonorycter quercifoliella, Tischeria ekebladella on Quercus robur and Q. petraea, Phyllonorycter klemannella on Alnus glutinosa are native leafminers. Phyllonorycter robiniella, Parectopa robinella on Robinia pseudoacacia, Phyllonorycter platani on Platanus sp., Cameraria ohridella on Aesculus hippocastanum and Phyllonorycter leucographella on Pyracantha coccinea are recently introduced invasive species in Croatia. In this research we tested the following hypotheses: a) native parasitoids have adapted to new hosts, b) these parasitoid species are generalists, c) native and alien species of leafminers with similar bioecological characteristics have similar parasitoid assemblages. The sites of research were chosen according to the host plant sites, in forests and parks in Croatia. The research was carried out from 2004-2006. Leaves with mines were collected and kept in glass containers in outside insectary until emergence of parasitoids. For each parasitoid assemblage the diversity indices were calculated: Domination index (D), Shannon's diversity index H and evenness of species E. Cluster analyses for comparison of similarities of parasitoid assemblages was done. In total, 28 taxa of parasitoids from the superfamily Chalcidoidea and 4 taxa from the superfamily of Ichneumonoidea have been found (Table 1). Table 1 shows domination index (D) for parasitoid species found for a host leaf miner. This research compares the parasitoid assemblages of different species of leafminers, the results have been obtained after mass rearings of parasitoids from different localities and different collection times and it does not give detailed insight into parasitism percentages and the seasonal distribution of parasitoid species within a parasitoid assemblage. Table 2 shows values of Shannon's diversity index H and evenness of species E, and Figure 1 shows dendrogram from cluster analyses grouping leaf miner species according to the similarities of their parasitoid assemblages. The majority of parasitoid species found are generalist species found on other species of leaf miners from the order Lepidoptera. P. roboris/P. quercifoliella have the most diverse parasitoid assemblage (the highest H value) (Table 2) followed by T. ekebladella. Oaks support rich fauna of taxonomicaly and ecologicaly similar leaf miner species and free exchange of parasitoids is enabled among them. All the parasitoid species found on these leafminers are generalist. They also have the highest E value (Table 2) because they lack specific monophagous parasitoid species. P. klemannella has lower diversity indices H and E because of the dominance of specific parasitoids from Encyrtidae family. P. platani has two dominant parasitoid species Minotetrastichus platanellus and Pediobius saulius. Dendrogram shows that P. roboris/P. quercifoliella, P. robiniella, P. leucographella, Pa. robiniella i T. ekebladella have similar parasitoid assemblages. Very similar are T. ekebladella and Pa. robiniella, both host species grow on the same sites together (oak and black locust) and generalists can search for similar mines: white upper surface leaf mines. The greater linkage distance between P. klemannella i P. platani can be explained with the dominance of specific monophagous parasitoid species in the assemblage. The similarities between parasitoid assemblages of native (P. roboris/P. quercifoliella, T. ekebladella) and alien (P. leucographella, P. robiniella, Pa. robiniella, C. ohridella) leaf miner species show that the native generalist parasitoids have adapted to new hosts. Ten species of parasitoids have been found on C. ohridella, with Pediobius saulius and Minotetrastichus frontalis as two dominant species (Table 1).

The results revealed that the bugs dwelling on linden trees were nearly devoid of parasitic mites (only 5% were parasitized), whereas 29% of those collected on the ground were parasitized. The mean numbers of H. adleri found on the respective groups were clearly different. We also tested whether P. apterus is more likely to be infested by H. adleri during its final larval ecdysis. Laboratory experiments showed no differences between the infestation by the mite in adult bugs and adults emerged from the last instars.

                    "text": "Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is an economically important, destructive disease in Brazil and is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells. The bacterium has been found to be transmitted in Brazil by sharpshooter leafhoppers (Cicadellidae). Sharpshooters are present in most citrus growing areas of the United States. The sharpshooter leafhopper; Oncometopia nigricans Walker, frequently is found feeding on citrus in Florida. This sharpshooter transmits the X. fastidiosa strains that cause Pierce's disease of grape and ragweed stunt; Research was initiated to determine if O. nigricans was capable of vectoring the X. fastidiosa that causes CVC. In 59 different transmission tests, using 1 to 57 insects per test, transmission of the bacterium was observed 12 times (20.3%).

                "content": "Transmission of the citrus variegated chlorosis bacterium Xylella fastidiosa with the sharpshooter Oncometopia nigricans | Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is an economically important, destructive disease in Brazil and is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells. The bacterium has been found to be transmitted in Brazil by sharpshooter leafhoppers (Cicadellidae). Sharpshooters are present in most citrus growing areas of the United States. The sharpshooter leafhopper; Oncometopia nigricans Walker, frequently is found feeding on citrus in Florida. This sharpshooter transmits the X. fastidiosa strains that cause Pierce's disease of grape and ragweed stunt; Research was initiated to determine if O. nigricans was capable of vectoring the X. fastidiosa that causes CVC. In 59 different transmission tests, using 1 to 57 insects per test, transmission of the bacterium was observed 12 times (20.3%). Symptom development in the greenhouse was not a reliable indicator of transmission. Transmission was verified by specific polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Individual insects were able to transmit the bacterium. This information on sharpshooter transmission of CVC is needed to assess the threat posed by the CVC disease to the citrus industries in the United States."

Riparian hosts that do not maintain sufficient X. fastidiosa populations for acquisition may not be significant inoculum reservoirs. We examined X. fastidiosa populations in systemically infected riparian hosts (California blackberry, California grapevine, elderberry, Himalayan blackberry, periwinkle) at two coastal locations (Mendocino and Napa) with two methods of quantitation (culturing and real-time polymerase chain reaction) from 2003 to 2004. In summer and autumn, X. fastidiosa populations were above the threshold for BGSS acquisition in periwinkle, Himalayan blackberry, and California grapevine at both locations. The only X. fastidiosa-positive plants detected in spring at both locations were periwinkle and Himalayan blackberry, suggesting that these species may contribute to long-term survival of X. fastidiosa. California blackberry and elderberry may not be important reservoirs of X. fastidiosa, given that very few plants of either species maintained infections. Higher X. fastidiosa populations in California grapevine, Himalayan blackberry, and periwinkle in Napa, relative to plants in Mendocino, may partially explain the higher PD incidence in Napa vineyards.",

We tested the hypothesis that ALS is caused by PD and ALS strains in the field and found that both groups of X. fastidiosa caused ALS and overwintered within almonds after mechanical inoculation. Under greenhouse conditions, all isolates caused AILS and all isolates from grapes caused PD. However, isolates belonging to almond genetic groupings did not cause PD in inoculated grapes but systemically infected grapes with lower frequency and populations than those belonging to grape strains. Isolates able to cause both PD and ALS developed 10-fold-higher concentrations of X. fastidiosa in grapes than in almonds. In the laboratory, isolates from grapes overwintered with higher efficiency in grapes than in almonds and isolates from almonds overwintered better in almonds than in grapes. We assigned strains from almonds into groups I and II on the basis of their genetic characteristics, growth on PD3 solid medium, and bacterial populations within inoculated grapevines. Our results show that genetically distinct strains from grapes and almonds differ in population behavior and pathogenicity in grapes and in the ability to grow on two different media.",

Our results show that citrus and coffee X. fastidiosa isolates are biologically distinct. Cross-inoculation tests showed that isolates causing CVC and CLS in the field were able to colonize citrus and coffee plants, respectively, but not the other host, indicating biological isolation between the strains. The microsatellite analysis separated most X. fastidiosa populations tested on the basis of the host plant from which they were isolated. However, recombination among isolates was detected and a lack of congruency among phylogenetic trees was observed for the loci used in the MLST scheme. Altogether, our study indicates that CVC and CLS are caused by two biologically distinct strains of X. fastidiosa that have diverged but are genetically homogenized by frequent recombination.",

The microsatellite analysis separated most X. fastidiosa populations tested on the basis of the host plant from which they were isolated. However, recombination among isolates was detected and a lack of congruency among phylogenetic trees was observed for the loci used in the MLST scheme. Altogether, our study indicates that CVC and CLS are caused by two biologically distinct strains of X. fastidiosa that have diverged but are genetically homogenized by frequent recombination."

Information generated from the X. fastidiosa genome project is being used to study the underlying mechanisms responsible for pathogenicity. However, the lack of an experimental host other than citrus to study plant-X. fastidiosa interaction has been an obstacle to accelerated progress in this area. We present here results of three experiments that demonstrated that tobacco could be an important experimental host for X. fastidiosa. All tobacco plants inoculated with a citrus strain of X. fastidiosa expressed unequivocal symptoms, consisting of orange leaf lesions, approximately 2 months after injection of the pathogen. CVC symptoms were observed in citrus 3 to 6 months after inoculation. The pathogen was readily detected in symptomatic tobacco plants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and phase contrast microscopy. In addition, X. fastidiosa was reisolated on agar plates in 4 of 10 plants. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of cross sections of stems and petioles revealed the presence of rod shaped bacteria restricted to the xylem of inoculated plants. The cell size was within the limit typical of X. fastidiosa.",

Also present in these crops and infesting weeds, which ultimately could serve as sources of inoculum for the cultivated trees, are diverse populations of xylem-feeding leafhopper vectors. In order to assess host range of X. fastidiosa among weeds and to better understand their role in epidemics, field surveys, mechanical inoculations, and insect transmission tests were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture plating were used to detect the pathogen from plant tissues. X. fastidiosa was detected in 10 out of 23 species of the weed plants sampled in two citrus groves affected by CVC. None of the weed plants showed external symptoms. In the greenhouse, the average percentages of infection on plants mechanically inoculated with the CVC, CLS, and PLS strains of X. fastidiosa were, respectively, 25, 10, 0 in Medicago sativa; 70, 45, 20 in Echinochloa crus-galli; 45, 30, 0 in Brachiaria decumbens; 72, 70, 40 in Brachiaria plantaginea; 13, 10, 0 in Digitaria horizontalis; 31, 30, 0 in Solanum americanum; and 17, 0, 0 in Bidens pilosa. Symptoms were observed only in S. americanum and citrus and only when inoculated with the CVC strain. In insect transmission tests, the grass leafhopper Ferrariana trivittata was first caged on citrus plants showing CVC symptoms and then on healthy citrus and on the four most common weeds. No plants tested positive by PCR or culture, or showed symptoms for at least 4 months after inoculation. The amount of X. fastidiosa cells that may accumulate in weeds inoculated by leafhoppers is probably under insect acquisition thresholds, a factor that would limit their importance to the CVC epidemics, as studies on spatial distribution of diseased citrus trees over time indicate.",

For generalist pathogens, different pathogen strains, vector species, or host species may all contribute to variability in disease incidence.

This pathogen also has a diverse vector complex and multiple biologically distinct strains. We studied the implications of diversity in this pathogen-vector-host system, by quantifying variability in transmission efficiency of different X. fastidiosa strains (isolates from almond and grape genetic groups) for different host plants (grape, almond, and alfalfa) by two of the most important vectors in California: glassy-winged sharpshooter [Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar)] and green sharpshooter (Draeculacephala minerva Ball) (both Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Transmission of isolates of the almond strain by H. vitripennis did not differ significantly, whereas transmission varied significantly among isolates from the grape strain (15-90%). Host plant species did not affect H. vitripennis transmission. Conversely, D. minerva efficiency was mediated by both host plant species and pathogen strain. No acquisition of an almond isolate occurred regardless of plant type (0/122), whereas acquisition of a grape isolate from alfalfa was 10-fold higher than from grape or almond plants. These results suggest that pathogen, vector, and host diversity impose contingencies on the transmission ecology of this complex disease system. Studies aimed at the development of management strategies for X. fastidiosa diseases should consider the complexity of these interactions as they relate to disease spread.",

Both of these diseases cause significant production problems in the respective industries. The recent establishment of the glassy-winged sharpshooter in California has radically increased the threat posed by Pierces disease to California viticulture. Populations of this insect reach very high levels in citrus groves in California and move from the orchards into the vineyards, where they acquire inoculum and spread Pierce's disease in the vineyards. Here we show that strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from diseased citrus and coffee in Brazil can incite symptoms of Pierce's disease after mechanical inoculation into seven commercial Vitis vinifera varieties grown in Brazil and California. Thus, any future introduction of the CVC strains of X. fastidiosa into the United States would pose a threat to both the sweet orange and grapevine industries. Previous work has clearly shown that the strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from Pierce's disease- and CVC-affected plants are the most distantly related of all strains in the diverse taxon X. fastidiosa. The ability of citrus strains of X. fastidiosa to incite disease in grapevine is therefore surprising and creates an experimental system with which to dissect mechanisms used by X.,fastidiosa in plant colonization and disease development using the full genome sequence data that has recently become available for both the citrus and grapevine strains of this pathogen.",

Besides sweet oranges, only some mandarins, tangors, tangelos and one sour orange (C. aurantium) had the symptoms. Pathogen detection was negative in Poncirus trifoliata, Fortunella margarita, Citrus yuzu, Citrus limettioides, Citrus latifolia and Citrus paradisi.

The plants were examined visually for foliar or fruit symptoms, serologically by DIBA and Immunoblotting with a specific antiserum for the citrus variegated chlorosis bacterium, and by PCR with specific primers for the pathogens. All sweet orange varieties (C. sinensis) evaluated under high inoculum pressure displayed CVC symptoms. Besides sweet oranges, only some mandarins, tangors, tangelos and one sour orange (C. aurantium) had the symptoms. Pathogen detection was negative in Poncirus trifoliata, Fortunella margarita, Citrus yuzu, Citrus limettioides, Citrus latifolia and Citrus paradisi. 'Eureka', 'Feminello' and 'Monachello' lemons (C. limon) were non-hosts even under high inoculum pressure, but 'Camargo', 'Sanguino 2' and 'Amber' lemons tested positive. 'Comprida' citron (C. medica) and 'Periforme' pummelo (C. grandis) were symptomless hosts of X. fastidiosa."

                "content": "Suppression of bacterial leaf scorch symptoms in American elm through oxytetracycline microinjection | Ulmus americana trees, 2-6 m tall in Washington, DC, naturally infected with leaf scorch were injected in Aug. 1982 with oxytetracycline (OTC) using Mauget capsules (40 mg a.i. per cm d.b.h.) or a pipette (40 or 80 mg a.i. per cm d.b.h.) or left untreated. Treated trees were re-injected in June 1983 using prefilled Mauget capsules with 50 or 80 mg a.i. per cm d.b.h. All trees had symptoms in Aug. 1982 and contained xylem-inhabiting bacteria. By July 1983 7 of 10 untreated control trees showed scorch symptoms while only 2 of 29 treated trees did. By late Aug. symptoms were absent or reduced in 22 of 23 trees treated wih low OTC and 3 of 6 treated with high OTC concn. Symptom remission was most apparent in trees which had <20% of the canopy leaf area affected before treatment. Results support the suggestion that leaf scorch is caused by a xylem-inhabiting bacterium."

Fresh cross-sections of young twigs and leaf petioles were printed onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed in the laboratory. Analyses of a first group of 61 samples gave similar efficiency for the three diagnostic techniques for detection the bacterium (24 positive and 36 negative samples), except for a single sample which was positive only with DTBIA and PCR. Similar results were obtained by separately analyzing suckers and twigs collected from different sectors of tree canopies of a second group of 20 olive trees (ten symptomatic and ten symptomless). In this second test the three diagnostic techniques confirmed the irregular distribution of the bacterium in the tree canopies and erratic detectability of the pathogen in the young suckers. It is therefore necessary to analyse composite samples per tree which should be prepared with twigs collected from different sides of the canopy. The efficiency comparable to ELISA and PCR, combined with the advantages of easier handling, speed and cost, make DTBIA a valid alternative to ELISA in large-scale surveys for occurrence of X. fastidiosa. Moreover, the printing of membranes directly in the field prevents infections spreading to Xylella-free areas, through movement of plant material with pathogen vectors for laboratory testing.",

                "content": "Direct tissue blot immunoassay for detection of Xylella fastidiosa in olive trees | A direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA) technique has been compared with ELISA and PCR for detection of Xylella fastidiosa in olive trees from Apulia (southern Italy). Fresh cross-sections of young twigs and leaf petioles were printed onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed in the laboratory. Analyses of a first group of 61 samples gave similar efficiency for the three diagnostic techniques for detection the bacterium (24 positive and 36 negative samples), except for a single sample which was positive only with DTBIA and PCR. Similar results were obtained by separately analyzing suckers and twigs collected from different sectors of tree canopies of a second group of 20 olive trees (ten symptomatic and ten symptomless). In this second test the three diagnostic techniques confirmed the irregular distribution of the bacterium in the tree canopies and erratic detectability of the pathogen in the young suckers. It is therefore necessary to analyse composite samples per tree which should be prepared with twigs collected from different sides of the canopy. The efficiency comparable to ELISA and PCR, combined with the advantages of easier handling, speed and cost, make DTBIA a valid alternative to ELISA in large-scale surveys for occurrence of X. fastidiosa. Moreover, the printing of membranes directly in the field prevents infections spreading to Xylella-free areas, through movement of plant material with pathogen vectors for laboratory testing."

To test the long-standing hypothesis that Pierce's disease results from pathogen-induced drought stress, we used the Affymetrix Vitis GeneChip to compare the transcriptional response of Vitis vinifera to Xylella infection, water deficit, or a combination of the two stresses. The results reveal a redirection of gene transcription involving 822 genes with a minimum twofold change (P < 0.05), including the upregulation of transcripts for phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, pathogenesis-related proteins, abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-responsive biosynthesis, and downregulation of transcripts related to photosynthesis, growth, and nutrition. Although the transcriptional response of plants to Xylella infection was largely distinct from the response of healthy plants to water stress, we find that 138 of the pathogen-induced genes exhibited a significantly stronger transcriptional response when plants were simultaneously exposed to infection and drought stress, suggesting a strong interaction between disease and water deficit. This interaction between drought stress and disease was mirrored in planta at the physiological level for aspects of water relations and photosynthesis and in terms of the severity of disease symptoms and the extent of pathogen colonization, providing a molecular correlate of the classical concept of the disease triangle in which environment impacts disease severity.",

Development of almond leaf scorch (ALS) disease was monitored on young almond (Prunus dulcis 'NePlus' and 'Peerless') shoots produced from almond scion wood that was high-grafted on peach rootstocks (P. persica 'Queencrest/Nemaguard'), after the almond shoots were mechanically inoculated with Xylella fastidiosa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential movement of X. fastidiosa through almond peach graft unions. ALS symptoms developed on both X. fastidiosa-inoculated and uninoculated almond shoots that were high-grafted on different peach limbs of the same tree in September following inoculations with X. fastidiosa made in June and July 2002, respectively, when the average distance in peach rootstock between the two almond peach graft unions was 30.5 cm or shorter. No ALS symptoms were observed on uninoculated almond shoots late in the growing season of the second year., The incidence of ALS-affected leaves on shoots inoculated with X. fastidiosa decreased in the second year on the inoculated shoots of Peerless as determined by the number of inoculated shoots showing ALS symptoms in 2002 versus 2003. No visible ALS symptoms were observed in NePlus late in the growing season of the second year, suggesting that survival of X. fastidiosa in NePlus was less than in Peerless. These data demonstrate that movement of X. fastidiosa through two almond peach graft unions was possible during the year of inoculation when the peach rootstock stem distance between the two almond peach graft unions was minimal However, X. fastidiosa may not survive the winter season or survived so poorly as not to be able to produce ALS symptoms in the second growing season on the uninoculated shoots that previously showed ALS symptoms in the fall of the year when an adjacent shoot was inoculated. The results suggest that high-grafting almond scion wood on multiple peach rootstock limbs may provide a means to limit movement of X. fastidiosa from one almond limb to another on the same tree.",
