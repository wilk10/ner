"Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) has been in the spotlight since the 2009 outbreak of human leishmaniosis in Madrid. In the framework of the Leishmaniosis Surveillance Programme set up in Madrid, this study examines Leishmania-specific seroprevalences in stray dogs for the outbreak area and rest of the Madrid region over the period spanning from the outbreak to the present (2009-2016). These data are of interest because stray dogs could be sentinels for disease surveillance in endemic areas. Since 2011, we have also been monitoring owned dogs in the outbreak area. Methods: Over the study period, Leishmania infantum seroprevalence was determined in 2,123 stray dogs from the outbreak and non-outbreak areas. A serological study was also performed for owned dogs in the outbreak area: high-risk dogs such as hunting or farm dogs (n = 1,722) and pets (n = 1372). All dogs were examined and blood was collected. The variables recorded for each animal were: breed, age, sex, and clinical history indicating if the animal was healthy or clinically suspected of having any disease, and if they showed a clinical picture compatible with CanL. Results: Seroprevalences of L. infantum in stray dogs were similar in the two areas examined: 4.7% (20 out of 346) in the outbreak area and 5.4% (96 out of 1,777) in the remaining Madrid region (Ï‡ 2 = 0.080, P = 0.777). A significant association was found between seroprevalence and age (z = -6.319; P &lt; 0.001). Seroprevalence in owned dogs in the outbreak area was 2.1% in high-risk dogs (37 out of 1,722) and 1.2% in pets (17 out of 1,372) (Ï‡ 2 = 3.561, P = 0.0591). Conclusions: Both stray and owned dogs do not seem to play an important role in maintaining the transmission cycle of L. infantum in the Madrid outbreak area. The stable seroprevalence of infection observed in sentinel dogs suggests the good clinical management and prevention of CanL by local practitioners in owned dogs.

"Canine hepatozoonosis caused by Hepatozoon canis is widespread in America. In Argentina, since the first finding of the disease in Buenos Aires in 1999, several isolated cases were reported in other six provinces. However, there is no information regarding hematological and epidemiological characterization of the disease in the country. A total of 100,123 canine blood samples obtained during the period 2002â€“2013 from Southern Greater Buenos Aires were examined by light microscopy. Overall prevalence was 2.3%, with high parasitemia levels (Â 800Â gamonts/Î¼l) in 680 samples, mild (100â€“800) in 1088, and low (Â 100) in 433 patients. Among parasitemic dogs, anemia (mostly non-regenerative) was present in 56.9%. Inflammatory leukogram, defined as neutrophilia with or without leukocytosis, with or without left shift and left shift with or without neutrophilia, was the main hematological abnormality and was present in 74.1% of positively tested dogs. A clear seasonal tendency was observed, with maximum values in summer and minimal in winter, and an increasing prevalence was recorded during the study decade. Young, male and mixed breed dogs showed higher prevalence values. Our findings strongly suggest that canine hepatozoonosis is endemic and expanding in the region.

"Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important public health challenge in Brazil because of the high number of human and canine cases reported annually. Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of VL and Lutzomyia longipalpis is its main vector. However, evidence suggests that this taxon constitutes a species complex. In Sao Paulo state, there are two populations of Lu. longipalpis, each secreting distinct pheromones, (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B and Cembrene 1; both have been associated with different patterns of VL transmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal distribution and natural infection of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lu. longipalpis complex in a highly VL endemic area of Sao Paulo state to obtain information that may contribute to the surveillance of this zoonosis and to the planning of preventive and control measures. Methods: The study was carried out in Panorama municipality, Sao Paulo State. Captures were made during 24 months in seven domiciles. The relation between sand fly abundance and climatic variables, temperature and humidity, was analyzed and natural infection by Leishmania spp. in sand fly females was investigated by nested PCR. Results: A total of 4120 sand flies, with predominance of Lu. longipalpis (97.2%) were captured. The highest averages of sand flies/night/trap occurred in the rainy season (November-March) and a positive, significant correlation between sand fly abundance and the temperature and humidity 20 days before the capture days was found. Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in three out of 250 pools of females analyzed, giving an estimated minimum infection rate of 1.2%. Conclusion: The identification of the climatic association between the high abundance of the vector in this highly endemic VL focus constitutes a fundamental point for evaluating future vector and dog control measures and this information increases the data of VL foci in Sao Paulo state that could contribute to the public health authorities in planning prevention and control measures. The identification of natural infection by Le. infantum in Lu. longipalpis specimens reinforces the importance of entomological surveillance activities in this municipality.

"Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases frequent in the Mediterranean Basin. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a notifiable parasitic disease that increased in incidence in Morocco over the past few years and has recently emerged in several new foci, causing a public health problem in Morocco. The aim of this study is to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of VL in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 period in order to highlight important features and trends of VL and its epidemiology and to assess whether the activity of the unit reflects the situation of the disease at the national level and whether it could constitute an indicator of public health relevance. Two thousand four hundred and twenty one cases were reported in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 with an average annual reported incidence rate of 0.4 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. Before 1996 the average annual incidence of VL was 50 cases on average. After this date the number of cases increased and then remained stable with around 100â€“150 cases per year. Children whose age varies between 1 and 4 years old are the most affected with 1327 (74%) of total cases; nevertheless the adult starts to be affected by the disease. In 2000, 65% of positive cases of VL are concentrated at both northern regions: Taza-Al Hoceima- Taounate with 45% of cases, Tanger- Tetouan mainly represented by Chefchaoun with 20% of cases. The Fez-Boulemane region located in the center recorded 12% of cases. Throughout the years the map VL distribution has been progressively changed and spatial spread of the disease to the center is noted in 2007. 2014 has been marked by an even greater extension of the disease to the center and south of Morocco. Nationally in 2014, 34 of 75 provinces and prefectures are affected compared to 2000, when 22 out of 82 provinces and prefectures were affected. Leishmania infantum was identified the causative agent based on species- specific PCR-Lei70 assay. VL remains a sporadically endemic parasitic disease in Morocco with a progressive extension of its range of distribution. Such a situation would relate to the geographical succession of Phlebotomine sand fly vectors, the difficulty of actions against the canine population reservoirs of L. infantum and unfavorable socio-economic factors.

"Introduction Outbreaks of human leishmaniasis are not very common in Spain, despite being considered an endemic disease. In this study, a new outbreak in the Valencian Community is presented. Its principal objective is to describe the clinical-epidemiological characteristics and to present the main Public Health measures established to contain the outbreak. Methods A case was defined as anyone residing in the village of Tous (in Valencian Community), diagnosed with leishmaniasis according to clinical and laboratory criteria, defined by the Epidemiological Surveillance Network, and date of symptoms onset between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. A descriptive analysis was performed on the epidemiological variables collected. Results A total of 19 cases were reported from the 28th week of 2012 to the 30th week of 2013. Adults were most affected by the disease (73%). The most common clinical form was cutaneous leishmaniasis (89%). More than three-quarters (79%) of cases were confirmed by PCR. Species typing was performed on seven samples, with the parasite Leishmania infantum being identified. Patient outcome was favourable after physical (31%), or pharmacological (69%) treatment. Some kind of residual damage was observed in 37% of cases. Different measures were applied, aimed at health professionals, and vector and reservoir control, as well as general recommendations to the population for the containment of the outbreak. Conclusions This cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreak confirms the endemic nature and the high prevalence of the disease in the Mediterranean area. The most commonly used treatment was intralesional meglumine antimoniate. A comprehensive plan of action had to be developed in order to control the outbreak.

"Vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) are a group of globally extended and quickly spreading pathogens that are transmitted by various arthropod vectors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the seroprevalence against Babesia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, and Ehrlichia canis in dogs in Croatia. We investigated 435 randomly selected apparently healthy dogs in 13 different locations of Croatia for antibodies to B. canis by indirect immunofluorescence using a commercial IFA IgG Antibody Kit. All samples were also tested for qualitative detection of D. immitis antigen and for antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi sensu lato, L. infantum, and E. canis with two point-of-care assays. Overall, 112 dogs (25.74%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.70-30.12) were serologically positive for one or more of the pathogens. B. canis was the most prevalent pathogen (20.00%, 95% CI 16.34-24.07), followed by A. phagocytophilum (6.21%, 95% CI 4.12-8.90), L. infantum, (1.38%, 95% CI 0.51-2.97), and B. burgdorferi sensu lato (0.69%, 95% CI 0.01-2.00). The lowest seroprevalence was for D. immitis and E. canis (0.46%, 95% CI 0.01-1.65). Coinfection was determined in 12 dogs (2.76%, 95% CI 1.43-4.77), of which 10 were positive to two pathogens (7 with B. canis and A. phagocytophilum and 1 B. canis with B. burgdorferi sensu lato or L. infantum or E. canis). One dog was positive to three pathogens and another dog to four pathogens. Seroprevalence for babesia was age, breed, and lifestyle/use dependent. Purebred dogs had almost half the chance of developing disease than crossbred (OR = 0.58, p < 0.026, 95% CI 0.37-0.94). Seropositivity to B. canis was 3.41 times higher for dogs that lived outdoors/shelter (p < 0.006) or 4.57 times higher in mixed/hunting (p < 0.001) compared to indoor/companion dogs. This is the first comprehensive survey of VBP seropositivity conducted in Croatia. Some of these VBPs are zoonotic and represent a potential risk to public health.

"Leishmaniasis is an arthropod-borne disease that affects approximately 2 million people worldwide annually. The aims of this study were to detect the presence of Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) DNA and the feeding preferences of probable vector species in an endemic focus of Leishmania infantum in Turkey. Entomological sampling was performed in August and October 2015 in AydÄ±n province, where cases of human and canine leishmaniasis have been reported previously. A total of 1059 sandfly specimens comprising nine species belonging to two genera, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia (both: Diptera: Psychodidae), and five subgenera of the Phlebotomus genus (Phlebotomus, Paraphlebotomus, Larroussius, Adlerius and Transphlebotomus) were collected in five villages. Among all Phlebotomus specimens, Phlebotomus neglectus (39%) was noted as the most abundant species, followed by Phlebotomus tobbi (18%). Leishmania DNA was detected in pools from P. neglectus, P. tobbi and Sergentomyia dentata by kDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Leishmania DNA from Phlebotomus specimens was identified as L. infantum, but Leishmania DNA from Sergentomyia spp. could not be identified to species level by ITS-1 real-time PCR.

"This study presents the results of a national survey in Spain on the distribution of ticks on owned dogs, their phenology and the associated pathogens over one year. In the study, 1628 adult ticks were collected on 660 dogs presented to 26 veterinary practices, of which 507 dogs (76.8%) carried at least one adult tick. The primary species of ticks were Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (53%), Dermacentor reticulatus (9%), Ixodes ricinus (9%), and I. hexagonus (4%). Parasitism by two species of these ticks was rare. The four species showed a clear association with the biogeographical features of the country, with I. ricinus associated with the wettest northern regions, I. hexagonus and D. reticulatus associated with the north of the territory, and R. sanguineus s.l. prevalent throughout the entire country. Dogs living in rural areas had a higher prevalence of all species, but R. sanguineus s.l. was the most prevalent; however, this tick was also more common on dogs living indoors. R. sanguineus s.l. adults were active throughout the year, with a maximum peak from March to July. The other tick species were collected throughout the year, with an autumn-winter peak of D. reticulatus, but without clear seasonality for either I. ricinus or I. hexagonus. Combined real-time PCR and conventional PCR of the feeding ticks recorded Piroplasmida (Hepatozoon canis, Babesia canis, B. gibsoni, and several sequences compatible with Theileria spp.), Rickettsia spp. (R. massiliae, R. sibirica mongolitimonae, R. monacensis), Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, A. phagocytophilum and Borrelia spp. (B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisiana). Hepatozoon canis and B. canis were the most frequently detected pathogens, with variable rates of infection according to the region. Other than a close association of Borrelia spp. with I. ricinus (and therefore to the wet northern areas of the territory), the other tick-borne pathogens were recorded throughout the country. Although a potential transmission role for ticks carrying unusual pathogens cannot be attributed to these results, these findings introduce a change of paradigm on the tick-borne pathogen distribution in Spain and emphasize the importance of performing active surveys to understand the complex patterns of tick-borne pathogen distributions and their vectors.

Other than a close association of Borrelia spp. with I. ricinus (and therefore to the wet northern areas of the territory), the other tick-borne pathogens were recorded throughout the country. Although a potential transmission role for ticks carrying unusual pathogens cannot be attributed to these results, these findings introduce a change of paradigm on the tick-borne pathogen distribution in Spain and emphasize the importance of performing active surveys to understand the complex patterns of tick-borne pathogen distributions and their vectors.

"To reveal the distribution of tick-borne parasites, we established a novel nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system to detect the most common agents of tick-borne parasitic diseases, namely Babesia, Theileria, and Hepatozoon parasites. We collected host-seeking or animal-feeding ticks in Kagoshima Prefecture, the southernmost region of Kyusyu Island in southwestern Japan. Twenty of the total of 776 tick samples displayed a specific band of the appropriate size (approximately 1.4â€“1.6Â kbp) for the 18S rRNA genes in the novel nested PCR (20/776: 2.58%). These PCR products have individual sequences of Babesia spp. (from 8 ticks), Theileria spp. (from 9 ticks: one tick sample including at least two Theileria spp. sequences), and Hepatozoon spp. (from 3 ticks). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these sequences were close to those of undescribed Babesia spp. detected in feral raccoons in Japan (5 sequences; 3 sequences being identical), Babesia gibsoni-like parasites detected in pigs in China (3 sequences; all sequences being identical), Theileria spp. detected in sika deer in Japan and China (10 sequences; 2 sequences being identical), Hepatozoon canis (one sequence), and Hepatozoon spp. detected in Japanese martens in Japan (two sequences). In summary, we showed that various tick-borne parasites exist in Kagoshima, the southern region in Japan by using the novel nested PCR system. These including undescribed species such as Babesia gibsoni-like parasites previously detected in pigs in China. Importantly, our results revealed new combinations of ticks and protozoan parasites in southern Japan. The results of this study will aid in the recognition of potential parasitic animal diseases caused by tick-borne parasites.

"Background Little is known regarding transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis (TTL) and the real global incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) among blood donors as carriers of Leishmania spp. in endemic VL foci including Iran. Recent epidemiological evidences indicate that blood donor may be harbor of Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) infection in Iran. Methods The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection among blood donors in a main endemic focus of VL in Iran using DAT and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods Between Julyâ€“September 2016, blood samples were collected from 600 apparently healthy blood donors from six blood donation centers and blood donation mobile unit in Ardabil Province, where VL cases had been recorded. Each of these samples was tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, in direct agglutination test (DAT), and for L. infantum kDNA, the PCR-based assay. Results Of 600 blood donors, which were examined, 23 (3.8%) blood donors were seropositive by DAT and of 23 seropositive subjects, 82.6% (19/23) were positive by PCR. All the seropositive cases were males except one of them was female. Conclusions Our findings showed that many asymptomatic human carriers of L. infantum live in the endemic regions of northwestern Iran and potentially act as reservoirs of infection; those must be considered carefully by arrangement VL control strategies in the country.

"The incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Albania is higher than in other countries of southern Europe, however the role of local sand fly species in the transmission of Leishmania infantum was not addressed conclusively. In 2006, a country-wide collection of sand flies performed in 14 sites selected based on recent occurrence of VL cases showed that Phlebotomus neglectus was by far the most prevalent species (95.6%). Furthermore, 15% of pools made from 422 P. neglectus females tested positive for Leishmania sp. genomic DNA. In the same year, Culicoides trapping was performed for bluetongue disease surveillance in 91 sites of southern Albania, targeting livestock farms regardless recent occurrence of VL in the surveyed areas. In 35 sites where sand flies were collected along with midges, Phlebotomus perfiliewi was the most prevalent among the Phlebotomus species identified, however search for leishmanial DNA in females of this species was unsuccessful. In 2011, sand flies were trapped in 4 sites of north Albania characterized by high VL incidence, and females were dissected to search for Leishmania infections. Both P. neglectus and P. tobbi were collected at high densities. Two positive specimens were detected from a sample of 64 P. neglectus trapped in one site (3.1%). Parasites were successfully cultured from one specimen and characterized as belonging to Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1, the only zymodeme so far identified as the agent of human and canine leishmaniasis in the country.

"Canine tick-borne apicomplexan parasites have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. A reverse line blot assay was performed on 219 blood samples collected from domestic dogs for simultaneous detection of all named canine piroplasm species as well as Hepatozoon canis. Ten samples hybridized to the Theileria/Babesia and Babesia catch all probes but did not hybridize to any species-specific probe tested, suggesting the presence of an unrecognized Babesia species or genotype. Sequencing results showed 91.5%, 91.9%, 92.4%, 92.4%, and 89.2% similarity to B. canis, B. vogeli, B. rossi, B. gibsoni, and B. conradae, respectively.

"Transmission of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is described in three consecutive generations of female Boxers living in a non-endemic environment in the Czech Republic. Infection of the first generation female likely occurred during a breeding visit to Italy and the dog died with typical clinical signs of the disease but without definitive laboratory diagnosis. The second and third generation offsprings never left the Czech Republic, suffered from clinical CanL confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and serology, and were apparently infected by transplacental transmission. Persistence of CanL in the Czech Republic over 7 years with a suspected origin in an endemic region and progression of infection through subsequent generations in a non-endemic country exemplifies that this disease may establish itself also in areas where no obvious vectors are present.

"Human leishmaniasis is an emerging problem in Italy and is on the increase in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern part of the country. Nevertheless, studies dealing with the molecular characterization of Leishmania spp. circulating in these areas are limited. In the present work, we explored the genetic polymorphism of Leishmania isolates from 28 cases of canine leishmaniasis and three cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which occurred in 2013-2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region. The characterization was carried out in comparison with nine human isolates of Leishmania from other VL endemic Italian regions and two reference strains. Nucleic acid from 31 Leishmania-positive phlebotomine sandfly pools, sampled in 2012-2013 in the Emilia-Romagna region, were also evaluated. DNA amplification and sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and of a repetitive nuclear region on chromosome 31 were carried out for genotyping. Two size polymorphic targets were also analyzed by PCR, the cpb E/F-gene and the k26-gene. Altogether, the analysis showed the circulation of different Leishmania infantum genotypes in the Emilia-Romagna region: two genotypes found in dogs from public kennels were similar to VL isolates from other Italian regions, whereas a third genotype was detected in VL cases of the Emilia-Romagna region and in all but one of the sandfly pools.

"African swine fever (ASF) is a widely known pig disease in Southwestern Nigeria because of the high mortality losses it produced in 1997-2006 outbreaks in the region. Sera from pigs were assayed for African swine fever virus (ASFV) antibodies to determine the presence and prevalence of ASFV infection in 28 pig herds in Southwestern Nigeria from 2006 to 2007. A total of 374 pigs were screened in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo States, Nigeria using the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay method. Out of the 28 farms, 2 were negative (7.1%) for ASFV antibodies. Thirteen out of 15 small herds (86.7%) and 13 out of 13 (100%) medium and large farms were positive for ASFV antibodies. Seroprevalence ranged from 50% (Ondo), 52.5% (Oyo), 59.8% (Lagos), and 60.7% (Ogun) to 70% (Osun). Seroprevalence was higher within the older stocks - finishers, gilts, sows and boars (77.3%-96.8%) than in the younger stocks - piglets, weaners, and growers (13.8%-39.7%). Almost all breeder stocks became infected. The overall prevalence rate of 65.2% (244/374) and average prevalence rate of 56.8% per farm were indicative of widespread ASFV infection in pig population in Southwestern Nigeria. This study shows the persistence of ASFV since its re-introduction into Southwestern Nigeria in 1997. This highlights the need for improved hygiene and biosecurity measures on pig farms, and also calls for renewed collaboration between livestock and veterinary extension services providers to implement strategies for ASFV control in Southwestern Nigeria."	1063	"Prevalence of African swine fever virus antibodies in pig herds in Southwest Nigeria"	"Prevalence of African swine fever virus antibodies in pig herds in Southwest Nigeria | African swine fever (ASF) is a widely known pig disease in Southwestern Nigeria because of the high mortality losses it produced in 1997-2006 outbreaks in the region.

Out of the 28 farms, 2 were negative (7.1%) for ASFV antibodies. Thirteen out of 15 small herds (86.7%) and 13 out of 13 (100%) medium and large farms were positive for ASFV antibodies. Seroprevalence ranged from 50% (Ondo), 52.5% (Oyo), 59.8% (Lagos), and 60.7% (Ogun) to 70% (Osun). Seroprevalence was higher within the older stocks - finishers, gilts, sows and boars (77.3%-96.8%) than in the younger stocks - piglets, weaners, and growers (13.8%-39.7%). Almost all breeder stocks became infected. The overall prevalence rate of 65.2% (244/374) and average prevalence rate of 56.8% per farm were indicative of widespread ASFV infection in pig population in Southwestern Nigeria. This study shows the persistence of ASFV since its re-introduction into Southwestern Nigeria in 1997. This highlights the need for improved hygiene and biosecurity measures on pig farms, and also calls for renewed collaboration between livestock and veterinary extension services providers to implement strategies for ASFV control in Southwestern Nigeria."
"Background: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been increasingly reported in dogs and cats worldwide. However, no data are currently available regarding canine and feline VBDs in Qatar and limited information is available from other Persian Gulf countries. Methods: Blood samples from 98 client-owned animals (i.e. 64 dogs and 34 cats) living in Doha (Qatar) were collected and the presence of genomic DNA of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Dirofilaria spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time-PCR (rt-PCR) and sequence analysis. Results: Of the 64 dogs, 12 (18.8%) were infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 7.8% with Mycoplasma spp., 4.7% with Babesia vogeli, 3.1% with Ehrlichia canis, and 1.6% with Anaplasma platys, Babesia gibsoni and Hepatozoon canis, each). One of the 12 dogs was co-infected with B. vogeli and E. canis. Of the 34 cats, seven (20.6%) animals were infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 5.9% were positive for Mycoplasma spp., and 2.9% for Babesia felis, B. vogeli, E. canis, \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" and Mycoplasma haemofelis, each). No dogs or cats were positive for Dirofilaria spp. or Rickettsia spp. Conclusions: Although the sample sizes of dogs and cats herein analysed was moderately small, data from this study report the occurrence of A. platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis, H. canis and Mycoplasma spp. in domestic dogs and of B. felis, B. vogeli, \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\", E. canis and M. haemofelis in domestic cats from Qatar.

"In the present study, a total of 192 blood samples were collected from pet dogs, kennel dogs and shepherd dogs in Konya district, Turkey, and tested by specific PCR for the presence of vector-borne pathogens. Several pathogens were identified, most of which can cause substantial morbidity in dogs. PCR results revealed that 54 (28.1%) dogs were infected with one or more pathogens. Positive results were obtained for Babesia spp. in 4 dogs (2.1%), Hepatozoon spp. in 8 dogs (4.2%) and Mycoplasma spp. in 46 dogs (24%). Three dogs (1.6%) were infected with two or three pathogens. The sequence analysis of the positive DNA samples revealed the presence of Babesia canis vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Hepatozoon sp. MF, Mycoplasma haemocanis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum. Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys were not detected. Regardless of ownership status, vector-borne diseases were common in these dog populations. There was significant difference of pathogen prevalence among the different dog populations. Mycoplasma spp. was more frequent in the kennel dogs (31.9%) than in the pet (21.4%) and shepherd dogs (13.8%). Additionally, the frequency of Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. was higher in the shepherd dogs which account for three quarters and half of the total number of Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp., respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Mycoplasma infection in dogs in Turkey.

"To investigate West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in rural populations in Gabon, we undertook a large serological survey focusing on human rural populations, using two different ELISA assays. A sample was considered positive when it reacted in both tests. A total of 2320 villagers from 115 villages were interviewed and sampled. Surprisingly, the WNV-specific IgG prevalence was high overall (27.2%) and varied according to the ecosystem: 23.7% in forested regions, 21.8% in savanna, and 64.9% in the lakes region. The WNV-specific IgG prevalence rate was 30% in males and 24.6% in females, and increased with age. Although serological cross-reactions between flaviviruses are likely and may be frequent, these findings strongly suggest that WNV is widespread in Gabon. The difference in WNV prevalence among ecosystems suggests preferential circulation in the lakes region. The linear increase with age suggests continuous exposure of Gabonese populations to WNV. Further investigations are needed to determine the WNV cycle and transmission patterns in Gabon."	1065	"First serological evidence of West Nile virus in human rural populations of Gabon"	"First serological evidence of West Nile virus in human rural populations of Gabon | To investigate West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in rural populations in Gabon, we undertook a large serological survey focusing on human rural populations, using two different ELISA assays.

"Background: Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, transmitted to humans by sandflies. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is often challenging as it mimics many other infectious or malignant diseases. The disease can present in three ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis, which rarely occur together or consecutively. Case presentation: The patient was a 52 years old immunosuppressed Belgian woman with a long history of severe rheumatoid arthritis. She underwent bone marrow biopsy to explore thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made by identification of Leishman Donovan (LD) bodies in macrophages. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was successful. She later developed cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with amphotericin B lipid complex. She next presented with relapsing cutaneous lesions followed by rapidly progressing lymphadenopathies. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Treatments by miltefosine, amphotericin B, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate were subsequently initiated. She later presented a recurrent bone marrow involvement treated with intramuscular paromomycin and miltefosine. She died two years later from leukemia. At the time of death, she presented with a mucosal destruction of the nose. A Leishmania-specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) identified L. infantum as etiological agent. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the potential concomitant or sequential involvement of multiple anatomic localizations of Leishmania in immunosuppressed patients.

"West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne Flavivirus usually transmitted to wild birds by Culex mosquitoes. Humans and horses are susceptible to WNV but are dead-end hosts. WNV is endemic in Senegal, particularly in the Senegal River Delta. To assess transmission patterns and potential vectors, entomological and sentinel serological was done in Ross Bethio along the River Senegal. Three sentinel henhouses (also used as chicken-baited traps) were set at 100 m, 800 m, and 1,300 m from the river, the latter close to a horse-baited trap. Blood samples were taken from sentinel chickens at 2-week intervals. Seroconversions were observed in sentinel chickens in November and December. Overall, the serological incidence rate was 4.6% with 95% confidence interval (0.9; 8.4) in the sentinel chickens monitored for this study.

"A cross-sectional and longitudinal serological study was conducted on domestic ruminants in Al-Hasa Oasis to clarify the presence, prevalence and distribution of Rift Valley Fever (RVF). A total of 598 serum samples were collected from sheep, goats, cattle and camel during the year 2007. Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect the presence of anti-RVF IgG and IgM antibodies in sheep, goats and cattle sera. Camel sera were tested by isotype-nonspecific inhibition ELISA. Two out of 225 sheep sera were IgG, but not IgM, seropositive, other sera were IgG and IgM seronegative. In a single sentinel herd of 40 sheep, which was established in the oasis, no seroconversion was detected during the period from July 2005 to May 2008. The low intra-herd prevalence, the scattered distribution of the two seropositives, the absence anti-RVF IgM antibody and the absence of RVF-incidence in the sentinel herd, all suggest that the seropositive animals were introduced from outside of the oasis rather than infected inside the oasis.

Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect the presence of anti-RVF IgG and IgM antibodies in sheep, goats and cattle sera. Camel sera were tested by isotype-nonspecific inhibition ELISA. Two out of 225 sheep sera were IgG, but not IgM, seropositive, other sera were IgG and IgM seronegative. In a single sentinel herd of 40 sheep, which was established in the oasis, no seroconversion was detected during the period from July 2005 to May 2008. The low intra-herd prevalence, the scattered distribution of the two seropositives, the absence anti-RVF IgM antibody and the absence of RVF-incidence in the sentinel herd, all suggest that the seropositive animals were introduced from outside of the oasis rather than infected inside the oasis. The prospective study shows that readiness of the region to RVF outbreak is possible."
"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne phlebovirus reported to be circulating in most parts of Africa. Since 2009, RVFV has been suspected of continuously circulating in the Union of Comoros. To estimate the incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition in the Comorian ruminant population, 191 young goats and cattle were selected in six distinct zones and sampled periodically from April 2010 to August 2011. We found an estimated incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition of 17.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): [8.9-26.1]) with a significant difference between islands (8.2% in Grande Comore, 72.3% in Moheli and 5.8% in Anjouan). Simultaneously, a longitudinal entomological survey was conducted and ruminant trade-related information was collected. No RVFV RNA was detected out of the 1,568 blood-sucking caught insects, including three potential vectors of RVFV mosquito species. Our trade survey suggests that there is a continuous flow of live animals from eastern Africa to the Union of Comoros and movements of ruminants between the three Comoro islands. Finally, a cross-sectional study was performed in August 2011 at the end of the follow-up. We found an estimated RVFV antibody prevalence of 19.3% (95% CI: [15.6%-23.0%]). Our findings suggest a complex RVFV epidemiological cycle in the Union of Comoros with probable inter-islands differences in RVFV circulation patterns. Moheli, and potentially Anjouan, appear to be acting as endemic reservoir of infection whereas RVFV persistence in Grande Comore could be correlated with trade in live animals with the eastern coast of Africa. More data are needed to estimate the real impact of the disease on human health and on the national economy."	119	"Evidence for Circulation of the Rift Valley Fever Virus among Livestock in the Union of Comoros"	"Evidence for Circulation of the Rift Valley Fever Virus among Livestock in the Union of Comoros | Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne phlebovirus reported to be circulating in most parts of Africa.

"The seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever was determined in cattle, sheep and goats in selected areas of northern and central Burkina Faso. A total of 520 serum samples were screened for anti-Rift Valley fever virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An average seroprevalence of 7.67% (range 5% to 20%) was found in ruminants in Seno and Soum provinces, and prevalences of 20% and 22.5% in cattle in Yatenga and Oubritenga provinces, respectively. The location, species and age of the animals were found to influence the seroprevalence. All the ELISA IgG-positive samples were tested for IgM in a competitive ELISA and were found negative, thus ruling out recent infections. The IgG-positive samples, including weak positives, were further tested in a serum neutralisation test for neutralising antibodies and 54.5% of these samples tested positive. The results show that the virus is in circulation in central and northern regions of Burkina Faso, suggesting the need for improved surveillance and control systems to prevent future outbreaks and the consequent economic impact of the disease in Burkina Faso livestock."	88	"Prevalence of Rift Valley fever in domestic ruminants in the central and northern regions of Burkina Faso"	"Prevalence of Rift Valley fever in domestic ruminants in the central and northern regions of Burkina Faso | The seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever was determined in cattle, sheep and goats in selected areas of northern and central Burkina Faso.

"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a fatal arthropod-borne zoonotic disease of livestock and humans. Since the identification of RVF in Kenya in the 1930s, repeated epizootics and epidemics coinciding with El Nino events have occurred in several locations in Africa and Saudi Arabia, causing mass deaths of livestock and humans. RVF is of great interest worldwide because of its negative effect on international livestock trade and its potential to spread globally. The latter is due to the increasing incidence of extreme climatic phenomena caused by global warming, as well as to the increase in global trade and international travel. How RVF is maintained and sustained between epidemics and epizootics is not clearly understood, but it has been speculated that wildlife reservoirs and trans-ovarian transmission in the vector may be important. Several studies have examined the role of wildlife and livestock in isolation or in a limited geographical location within the one country over a short time (usually less than a year). In this study, we examined the seroprevalence of anti-RVF antibodies in cattle and several wildlife species from several locations in Kenya over an inter-epidemic period spanning up to 7 years. METHODS: A serological survey of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to RVF using competitive ELISA was undertaken on 297 serum samples from different wildlife species at various locations in Kenya. The samples were collected between 2008 and 2015. Serum was also collected in 2014 from 177 cattle from Ol Pejeta Conservancy; 113 of the cattle were in close contact with wildlife and the other 64 were kept separate from buffalo and large game by an electric fence. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of RVF virus (RVFV) antibody was 11.6% in wildlife species during the study period. Cattle that could come in contact with wildlife and large game were all negative for RVFV. The seroprevalence was relatively high in elephants, rhinoceros, and buffalo, but there were no antibodies in zebras, baboons, vervet monkeys, or wildebeest. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse species in conservation areas are exposed to RVFV. RVFV exposure in buffalo may indicate distribution of the virus over wide geographical areas beyond known RVFV foci in Kenya. This finding calls for thorough studies on the epizootology of RVFV in specific wildlife species and locations."	68	"Spatio-temporal variation in prevalence of Rift Valley fever: a post-epidemic serum survey in cattle and wildlife in Kenya"	"Spatio-temporal variation in prevalence of Rift Valley fever: a post-epidemic serum survey in cattle and wildlife in Kenya | BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a fatal arthropod-borne zoonotic disease of livestock and humans.

"Visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic and chronic disease and dogs are the main reservoir of the etiologic agent, Leishmania infantum (syn L. chagasi). A serological and molecular investigation of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was performed in the municipality of Alfenas, located in the southern region of Minas Gerais, where the disease is not endemic. Samples from 87 dogs were submitted to serological tests including the Dual Path Platform (DPP (r) ) CVL Bio-Manguinhos rapid test, an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), as well as molecular techniques such as a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the RV1/RV2 primers and a quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the LinJ31, Ldon and DNApol primers. Of the 87 serum samples, eight (9.2%) were positive for Leishmania using the DPP rapid test, but only four (4.6%) were confirmed by ELISA and two (2.3%) by IFAT. In these two serologically confirmed cases, spleen and liver samples were positive by all the employed molecular and parasitological procedures performed on spleen samples. When whole blood samples were used in the molecular assays, two samples (2.3%) were positive only by qPCR. DNA extracted and amplified from the spleens of seropositive dogs was sequenced, showing 100% of similarity with the Leishmania infantum (syn L. chagasi) sequence.

"Leishmania (L.) infantum is the causative agent in an endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in the Mont-Rolland district (ThiÃ¨s, Senegal). In this area, the transmission cycle is well established and more than 30% of dogs and 20% of humans are seropositive for L. infantum. However, the sand fly species involved in L. infantum transmission cycle are still unknown. Between 2007 and 2010, 3654 sand flies were collected from different environments (indoor, peridomestic, farming and sylvatic areas) to identify the main L. infantum vector(s). Nine sand fly species were identified. The Phlebotomus genus (n = 54 specimens; Phlebotomus (Ph) duboscqi and Phlebotomus (Ph). rodhaini) was markedly under-represented in comparison to the Sergentomyia genus (n = 3600 specimens; Sergentomyia (Se) adleri, Se. clydei, Se. antennata, Se. buxtoni, Se. dubia, Se. schwetzi and Se. magna). Se. dubia and Se. schwetzi were the dominant species indoor and in peridomestic environments, near humans and dogs. Blood-meal analysis indicated their anthropophilic behavior. Some Se. schwetzi specimens fed also on dogs. The dissection of females in the field allowed isolating L. infantum from sand flies of the Sergentomyia genus (0.4% of Se. dubia and 0.79% of Se. schwetzi females). It is worth noting that one Se. dubia female not engorged and not gravid revealed highly motile metacyclic of L. infantum in the anterior part of the midgut. PCR-based diagnosis and sequencing targeting Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) highlighted a high rate of L. infantum-positive females (5.38% of Se. dubia, 4.19% of Se. schwetzi and 3.64% of Se. magna). More than 2% of these positive females were unfed, suggesting the parasite survival after blood-meal digestion or egg laying. L. infantum prevalence in Se. schwetzi was associated with its seroprevalence in dogs and humans and L. infantum prevalence in Se. dubia was associated with its seroprevalence in humans. These evidences altogether strongly suggest that species of the Sergentomyia genus are probably the vectors of canine leishmaniasis in the Mont-Rolland area and challenge one more time the dogma that in the Old World, leishmaniasis is exclusively transmitted by species of the Phlebotomus genus.

"Leishmaniosis are zoonoses that present several clinical manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir in the urban environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in SÃ£o Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded for the first time in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPPÂ® and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83% (250/300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58% (175/300) were female, 78% (238/300) slept outdoors, and 61% (183/300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90% (270/300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70% (210/300) had dermatopathies, 24% (72/300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22% (65/300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100% concordant for the three seropositive samples (1%), and the remaining 297 (99%) were negative for both tests.

"This study primarily aimed to identify the causative species of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan and to distinguish any species-specific variation in clinical manifestation of CL. Diagnostic performance of different techniques for identifying CL was assessed. Isolates of Leishmania spp. were detected by in vitro culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from dried filter papers and microscopic examination of direct lesion smears from patients visiting three major primary care hospitals in Peshawar. A total of 125 CL patients were evaluated. Many acquired the disease from Peshawar and the neighboring tribal area of Khyber Agency. Military personnel acquired CL while deployed in north and south Waziristan. Leishmania tropica was identified as the predominant infecting organism in this study (89.2%) followed by Leishmania major (6.8%) and, unexpectedly, Leishmania infantum (4.1%). These were the first reported cases of CL caused by L. infantum in Pakistan. PCR diagnosis targeting kinetoplast DNA was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying 86.5% of all samples found positive by any other method.

Diagnostic performance of different techniques for identifying CL was assessed. Isolates of Leishmania spp. were detected by in vitro culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from dried filter papers and microscopic examination of direct lesion smears from patients visiting three major primary care hospitals in Peshawar. A total of 125 CL patients were evaluated. Many acquired the disease from Peshawar and the neighboring tribal area of Khyber Agency. Military personnel acquired CL while deployed in north and south Waziristan. Leishmania tropica was identified as the predominant infecting organism in this study (89.2%) followed by Leishmania major (6.8%) and, unexpectedly, Leishmania infantum (4.1%). These were the first reported cases of CL caused by L. infantum in Pakistan. PCR diagnosis targeting kinetoplast DNA was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying 86.5% of all samples found positive by any other method.

"Background: The occurrence of phlebotomine sand flies in Central Europe was questioned until they were recorded for the first time in Germany in 1999, and ten years later also in Austria. The aim of this study was to investigate sand flies collected in Austria for their carrier status of Leishmania spp. Findings: From 2012 to 2013 field studies were conducted in eastern Austria. Altogether, 22 individuals of sand flies were found, all morphologically identified as Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii Grassi, 1908. Twelve non-engorged female specimens with no visible remnants of a blood meal in their bodies were individually investigated for Leishmania spp. by ITS-1 real-time PCR. One out of these was positive for Leishmania, identified as Leishmania infantum by DNA sequencing. This finding suggests that L. infantum is not excreted by P. mascittii and possibly can establish an infection within P. mascittii. Interestingly, an asymptomatic dog living on the farm where this sand fly had been caught was also Leishmania-positive. Conclusions: This study provides new data on the suspected vector capacity of P. mascittii, being the northernmost sand fly species in Europe and in most central European regions the only sand fly species found. Proven vector capacity of P. mascittii for Leishmania spp. would be of significant medico-veterinary importance, not only with respect to expanding sand fly populations in Central Europe related to global warming, but also in the light of globalization and increasing movements of humans.

"In Brazil, canine hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne subclinical hemoparasitosis caused by a protozoa Hepatozoon canis and is highly prevalent in dogs in rural areas. An epizootiological study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of H. canis in the canine population of ItuberÃ¡, Bahia, and to analyze any associated risk factors. Blood samples were collected from 380 dogs and determined the presence of the protozoan by performing capillary blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Epizootiological data were collected by asking dog owners to answer a structured questionnaire. H. canis gamonts were not detected in the blood smears. However, PCR detected H. canis in 163/380 (42.9%) dogs examined. Physical examination and anamnesis indicated 105 (64.4%) positive asymptomatic dogs. Hematological alterations were observed in 115 (70.5%) infected dogs. No clinical, hematological, or epizootiological variable was found to be significantly associated to the infection. In conclusion, the high prevalence of H. canis infection in local dogs may be because of the peri-urban features of this municipality.

"Leishmaniasis caused by more than 20 species of genus Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies. The studies on Leishmania infection in cats is very few in Turkey and therefore we aimed to screen stray cats living in city of IË™zmir located in western Turkey using nested PCR targeting kinetoplast DNA and serological techniques (ELISA and IFA). Leishmania DNA positive samples were also studied by ITS1 real time PCR.Whole blood and serum samples were obtained from stray cats (n: 1101) living in different counties of IË™zmir. In serological assays, a serum sample was considered positive in 1:40 dilution in IFA and for ELISA a serum sample was accepted positive when the absorbance value (AV) exceeded the mean AV + Standard Deviation (SD) of the negative control serum samples.According to the results, the seropositivity rates were 10.8% (119/1101) and 15.2% (167/1101) by in house ELISA and IFA, respectively. Among serology coherent samples, the seropositivity rate was 11.1% (116/1047) as detected by both assays after discordant samples (n: 54) were discarded. Of the 1101 stray cats, six (0.54%) were positive by nested PCR while only one of these six samples was positive by ITS1 real time PCR.During PCR, three controls designated as Leishmania infantum, Leishmania tropica, and Leishmania major were used for species identification. According to nested PCR results, L. tropica was identified in two cats (no.76 and 95). In another cat (no. 269), there were two bands in which one of them was well-matched with L. infantum and the other band had ~850 bp size which does not match with any controls. Remaining three cats (no. 86, 514, and 622) also had the ~850 bp atypical band size. ITS1 real time PCR detected L. tropica in only one cat (no. 622) which showed an atypical band size in nested PCR. These results indicated that three cats with only one atypical band (no. 86, 514, and 622) and the cat with mixed infection (no. 269) were infected with L. tropica. Altogether, L. tropica was detected in all six DNA positive cats and L. infantum was detected in one cat with mixed infection.In conclusion, although the reservoir role of cats in nature is still unclear the high seroprevalence rate against Leishmania parasites and detecting parasite DNA in stray cats in IË™zmir indicates that the stray cats are frequently bitten by infected sand flies.

"Tick-borne diseases are emerging worldwide and have an important zoonotic relevance. Dogs play an important role in the epidemiology of several zoonotic tick-borne pathogens acting as sentinels and/or reservoirs. This study focused on the molecular identification of tick-borne pathogens in blood samples of 153 autochthonous asymptomatic dogs in Maio Island, Cape Verde archipelago. Eighty-four (54.9%) dogs were positive for one or more pathogens. Fifty-five (35.9%) dogs were infected with Hepatozoon canis, 53 (34.6%) with Anaplasma platys, five (3.3%) with Ehrlichia canis and Rickettsia monacensis, an emerging human pathogen, was also identified in a single dog (0.7%). The former three pathogens cause important canine tick-borne diseases that are transmitted or potentially transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l., the only hard tick identified in Cape Verde. Furthermore, Wolbachia spp. was amplified from the blood of one dog. None of the dogs were positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Midichloria mitochondrii, Bartonella spp., Babesia spp. or Theileria spp. Fifty-four (35.3%) animals showed single infections and 30 (19.6%) co-infections, with A. platys and H. canis co-infection being the most frequent (28 dogs, 18.3%).

"Ixodid ticks transmit various infectious agents that cause disease in humans and livestock worldwide. A cross-sectional survey on the presence of protozoan pathogens in ticks was carried out to assess the impact of tick-borne protozoa on domestic animals in Palestine. Ticks were collected from herds with sheep, goats and dogs in different geographic districts and their species were determined using morphological keys. The presence of piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. was determined by PCR amplification of a 460â€“540Â bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene followed by RFLP or DNA sequencing. A PCR-RFLP method based on the 18S rRNA was used in order to detect and to identify Hepatozoon, Babesia and Theileria spp. A total of 516 ticks were collected from animals in six Palestinian localities. Five tick species were found: Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Haemaphysalis parva and Haemaphysalis adleri. PCR-based analyses of the ticks revealed Theileria ovis (5.4%), Hepatozoon canis (4.3%), Babesia ovis (0.6%), and Babesia vogeli (0.4%).

"Visceral leishmaniasis is not endemic in West Africa. However, high seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection (one of the Leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis) was detected in dogs and humans in the Mont Rolland community (close to ThiÃ¨s, Senegal), despite the lack of reports concerning human clinical cases. Our aim was to genetically characterize this L. infantum population and identify its origin. We thus conducted seven field surveys in 25 villages of the Mont Rolland community between 2005 and 2009 and blood samples were collected from 205 dogs. Serological testing indicated that 92 dogs (44.9%) were positive for Leishmania infection. L. infantum was identified as the cause of infection. Analysis of 29 L. infantum isolates from these dogs by multilocus microsatellite typing and multilocus sequence typing indicated that this population had very limited genetic diversity, low level of heterozygosity and only seven different genotypes (79.3% of all isolates had the same genotype). Multilocus sequence typing showed that the Mont Rolland isolates clustered with strains from the Mediterranean basin and were separated from East African and Asian strains.

Here, we performed a serologic study of domestic dogs in the municipality of Petrolina in northeastern Brazil to evaluate the possible risk factors associated with canine seropositivity for Leishmania infantum chagasi. Blood samples from 1245 dogs in urban and rural areas were collected and examined by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dogs were subjected to physical examination and classified according to their clinical manifestations. A questionnaire was administered to the owners to detect potential risk factors for infection with Leishmania spp. using logistic regression models. Of the 1245 dogs evaluated, 11.2% (140/1245) were seropositive in both tests (CI 95%: 9.5% to 13.1%). Approximately 60.7% of the reactive dogs were clinically suspect, with lymphadenomegaly, cutaneous ulcerations, onychogryphosis, pale mucous membranes and alopecia being the most obvious symptoms of infection. The seroprevalences in urban and rural areas were 5.4% (CI 95%: 4% to 7.1%) and 23.6% (CI 95%: 19.5% to 28.1%), respectively. The possible risk factors for the presence of anti L. infantum chagasi antibodies were the presence of a green area close to the home of the animal (ORÂ =Â 3.63; pÂ <Â 0.001), a mongrel breed (ORÂ =Â 2.11; pÂ =Â 0.025) and male gender (ORÂ =Â 1.51, pÂ =Â 0.034).

"Background: Canine leishmaniasis is a severe, potentially life-threatening, systemic vector-borne disease of dogs caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Romania has been traditionally regarded as a non-endemic country for leishmaniasis with sporadic human disease cases. However, the recent report of an autochthonous canine leishmaniasis case (the first in the last 80 years) suggested the presence of an infection focus in the area of RÃ¢mnicu VÃ¢lcea. The present study describes a survey of canine leishmaniasis in this geographical area with comparison to a georeferenced dataset of sand fly distribution based on historical literature records. Methods: The study was carried out in RÃ¢mnicu VÃ¢lcea and included samples (serum, blood and conjunctival swabs) collected from 80 dogs including client-owned dogs from two local practices and dogs from two public shelters. Serum anti-leishmanial antibodies were assessed by ELISA. All blood and conjunctival samples were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, targeting the leishmanial kinetoplast minicircle DNA. Results: Three dogs (3.7 %) were seropositive and another four (5.0 %) showed borderline results indicative of exposure or infection. TaqMan PCR was performed for all dogs, on both blood and conjunctival swabs. Seven dogs (8.7 %) were positive by conjunctival swab PCR and one dog (1.2 %) by blood PCR. None of the positive dogs presented clinical signs compatible with canine leishmaniasis. Conclusions: This is the first study evaluating canine leishmaniasis in a dog population in Romania by both highly sensitive PCR and serology. Although the prevalence was relatively low compared to other endemic regions, our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a canine leishmaniasis focus in Romania.

"Background: In Southeast Asia, the canine vector-borne pathogens Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Hepatozoon canis, haemotropic mycoplasmas and Dirofilaria immitis cause significant morbidity and mortality in dogs. Moreover, dogs have also been implicated as natural reservoirs for Rickettsia felis, the agent of flea-borne spotted fever, increasingly implicated as a cause of undifferentiated fever in humans in Southeast Asia. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of canine vector-borne pathogens in 101 semi-domesticated dogs from rural Cambodia using molecular diagnostic techniques. Results: The most common canine vector-borne pathogens found infecting dogs in this study were Babesia vogeli (32.7 %) followed by Ehrlichia canis (21.8 %), Dirofilaria immitis (15.8 %), Hepatozoon canis (10.9 %), Mycoplasma haemocanis (9.9 %) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum\" (2.9 %). A high level of co-infection with CVBD agents (23.8 %) was present, most commonly B. vogeli and E. canis. Naturally occurring R. felis infection was also detected in 10.9 % of dogs in support of their role as a natural mammalian reservoir for flea-borne spotted fever in humans. Conclusions: This study reports for the first time, the prevalence and diversity of CVBD pathogens in dogs in Cambodia. In total, five species of CVBD pathogens were found infecting semi-domesticated dogs and many were co-infected with two or more pathogens.

"Background: No molecular data have been available on tick-borne pathogens that infect dogs from Angola. The occurrence of agents from the genera Anaplasma, Babesia, Ehrlichia and Hepatozoon was assessed in 103 domestic dogs from Luanda, by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis. Results: Forty-six dogs (44.7 %) were positive for at least one pathogen. Twenty-one animals (20.4 %) were found infected with Anaplasma platys, 18 (17.5 %) with Hepatozoon canis, six (5.8 %) with Ehrlichia canis, six (5.8 %) with Babesia vogeli, one (1.0 %) with Babesia gibsoni and one (1.0 %) with an unnamed Babesia sp. The molecular frequency of single infections taken together was 37.9 % and that of co-infections with several combinations of two pathogens accounted for 6.8 % of the animals. Conclusions: This is the first report of A. platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis and H. canis infections diagnosed by PCR in domestic dogs from Angola. The present study provides evidence that dogs in Luanda are widely exposed to, and at risk of becoming infected with, tick-borne pathogens.

"Background: Vector-borne pathogens are the subject of several investigations due to the zoonotic concern of some of them. However, limited data are available about the simultaneous presence of these pathogens in cats and their ectoparasites. The aim of the present study was to define the species of ectoparasites found on cats as well as to investigate vector-borne pathogens in cats and their ectoparasites in southern Italy. Methods: Blood from 42 cats and fleas or flea pools (n = 28) and ticks (n = 73) collected from them were investigated by quantitative PCR for the detection of vector-borne pathogens. Feline serum samples were tested by IFAT to detect IgG antibodies against Leishmania infantum, Bartonella henselae, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia felis, Rickettsia typhi, Babesia microti, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum antigens. Results: Only one flea species (Ctenocephalides felis) and four tick species belonging to the genera Rhipicephalus and Ixodes were identified on cats from southern Italy. Molecular evidence of Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., hemoplasmas, Babesia vogeli and L. infantum was found in ectoparasites (fleas and/or ticks) while DNA from Hepatozoon felis and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. was not detected. Likewise, DNAs from Bartonella, hemoplasma and Leishmania were the only pathogens amplified from feline blood samples. Cats had also antibodies against all the investigated pathogens with the exception of Rickettsia typhi. Agreement between serological and molecular results in individual cats and their ectoparasites was not found. The only exception was for Bartonella with a fair to moderate agreement between individual cats and their ectoparasites. Bartonella clarridgeiae was the species most frequently found in cats and their fleas followed by B. henselae. Conclusions: In conclusion, cats harboring ticks and fleas are frequently exposed to vector-borne pathogens. Furthermore, ticks and fleas harbored by cats frequently carry pathogens of zoonotic concern therefore appropriate feline ectoparasiticide preventative treatments should be used in cats.

"Background: Leishmaniosis caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and dirofilariosis caused by the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis or Dirofilaria repens are vector-borne zoonoses widely present in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, some studies reported that the endosymbiont Wolbachia spp. play a role in the biology and pathogenesis of filarial parasites. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of mono- and co-infections by L. infantum, filariae and Wolbachia spp. and their association with clinical signs in dogs from the south of Portugal. Leishmanial, filarial and Wolbachia spp. DNA were evaluated by specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays in blood samples from 230 dogs. Findings: One hundred and thirty-nine (60.4 %) dogs were qPCR-positive for L. infantum and 26 (11.3 %) for filariae (24 for D. immitis only, one D. immitis and for Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides and another one for Acanthocheilonema reconditum only). Wolbachia spp. DNA was amplified from 16 (64.0 %) out of the 25 D. immitis-positive dogs. Nineteen (8.3 %) dogs were co-infected with L. infantum and D. immitis, including the one (0.4 %) A. drancunculoides-positive animal. In dogs without clinical signs consistent with leishmaniosis and/or dirofilariosis, L. infantum prevalence was 69 %, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical manifestation compatible with any of the two parasitoses prevalence was 42.7 %. Leishmania prevalence was significantly higher in apparently healthy mongrels (77.2 %) and pets (76.9 %) than in defined-breed dogs (including crosses; 58.8 %) and in dogs with an aptitude other than pet (i.e. farm, guard, hunting, shepherd or stray), respectively, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical sign, the detection of L. infantum DNA was higher in males (53.3 %) and in those dogs not receiving insect repellents (52.8 %). Conclusions: The molecular detection of canine vector-borne disease (CVBD) agents, some of which are zoonotic, reinforces the need to implement efficient prophylactic measures, such as insect repellents and macrocyclic lactones (including compliance to administration), in the geographical areas where these agents are distributed, with the view to prevent infection and disease among mammalian hosts including humans.

"Background: Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are increasingly being reported worldwide and represent a serious threat to both animal and public health. Military dogs may constitute a risk group for the agents causing these diseases, as they frequently work outdoors in different areas and are thus exposed to vector arthropods. In order to assess the risk of exposure of this type of dogs, a serological and molecular survey was conducted in military working dogs in Portugal. One hundred apparently healthy dogs were surveyed. Serum samples were tested for antigens of Angiostrongylus vasorum and Dirofilaria immitis; and for antibodies to A. vasorum, Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus. Serum was tested by polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), with sequencing of the DNA products. Results: Forty-nine per cent of the dogs were seropositive for antibodies against Rickettsia spp., 16 % for Anaplasma spp., 13 % for L. infantum, 7 % for E. canis, 5 % for A. vasorum (including 1 % positive for both antibodies and circulating antigens), 3 % for Babesia spp. and 1 % positive for Toscana virus. B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was detected in eight out of 94 dogs tested (8.5 %) and in three cases (3.2 %) nucleotide sequence analysis showed identity with the genospecies Borrelia afzelii. No positive cases were recorded for D. immitis. Overall, 66 % of the dogs were positive for at least one out of the eight tested CVBD agents, six of which are zoonotic (i.e. Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., E. canis, L. infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus). Serological specific antibody detection against more than one CVBD agent (including molecular detection of Borrelia spp.) was recorded in 25 % of the dogs, comprising 19 % with positive reaction to two agents, 5 % to three agents and 1 % to four agents. Conclusions: These results reveal a high occurrence of CVBD agents in military working dogs in Portugal and highlight the need to maintain a comprehensive and regular prophylaxis to reduce the contact between working dogs and those pathogens. For the first time in Portugal, B. afzelii DNA was identified in dogs and a dog was found seropositive for antibodies against Toscana virus.

"Background: Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a vector-borne disease affecting humans and other mammals and caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn. L. chagasi), belonging to the L. donovani complex. The regions in Northern Argentina (above 32 Â°S) are its southern distribution limit in South America. Results: We detected Leishmania sp. DNA (most likely belonging to the L. donovani complex) in 37.5 % of 32 grey foxes (Pseudalopex griseus) captured in Argentinean Patagonia (48Â°S and 50Â°S). Eleven monosexual pools of Amblyomma tigrinum ticks from eight different foxes (six grey foxes and two culpeo foxes P. culpaeus) were also positive. The southernmost known distribution limit for L. infantum, and the southernmost reported capture of a phlebotominae, had previously been 2000 and 750 km north of our study area, respectively. Conclusions: This finding is significant because it markedly extends the distribution area of leishmaniasis; supports the existence of a sylvatic cycle in the absence of dogs; and has implications in transmission, indicating that either sand fly distribution is broader than currently thought or non-sand fly Leishmania maintenance is possible. Additional molecular, parasitological, epidemiological and entomological studies are still needed."	82884	"Detection of Leishmania DNA in wild foxes and associated ticks in Patagonia, Argentina, 2000 km south of its known distribution area"	"Detection of Leishmania DNA in wild foxes and associated ticks in Patagonia, Argentina, 2000 km south of its known distribution area | Background: Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a vector-borne disease affecting humans and other mammals and caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn.

"Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic to the tropical regions of eastern and southern Africa. The seroprevalence of RVF was investigated among the human population in Borno State, Nigeria to determine the occurrence of the disease in the study area in comparison with that of Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever. Methods: Recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP)-based IgG-ELISAs for the detection of serum antibodies against RVF virus (RVFV), Lassa fever virus (LASV), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) were used to test human sera in Borno State, Nigeria. The presence of neutralizing antibody against the RVFV-glycoprotein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype (RVFVpv) was also determined in the human sera. Results: Of the 297 serum samples tested, 42 (14.1%) were positive for the presence of RVFV-IgG and 22 (7.4%) and 7 (2.4%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies against LASV and CCHFV, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained using RVFVpv and those obtained using the conventional neutralization assay with the attenuated RVFV-MP12 strain. Conclusions: The seroprevalence of RVF was significantly higher than that of LASV and CCHF in Borno State, Nigeria. The RVFVpv-based neutralization assay developed in this study has the potential to replace the traditional assays based on live viruses for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of RVF."	96	"Development and validation of serological assays for viral hemorrhagic fevers and determination of the prevalence of Rift Valley fever in Borno State, Nigeria"	"Development and validation of serological assays for viral hemorrhagic fevers and determination of the prevalence of Rift Valley fever in Borno State, Nigeria | Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic to the tropical regions of eastern and southern Africa.

Results: Of the 297 serum samples tested, 42 (14.1%) were positive for the presence of RVFV-IgG and 22 (7.4%) and 7 (2.4%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies against LASV and CCHFV, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained using RVFVpv and those obtained using the conventional neutralization assay with the attenuated RVFV-MP12 strain. Conclusions: The seroprevalence of RVF was significantly higher than that of LASV and CCHF in Borno State, Nigeria. The RVFVpv-based neutralization assay developed in this study has the potential to replace the traditional assays based on live viruses for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of RVF."
"Background: A mass Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination program targeting children was launched in Taiwan in 1968, and the number of pediatric JE cases substantially decreased thereafter. The aim of this study was to elucidate the long-term trend of JE incidence, and to investigate the age-specific seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 2,948 laboratory-confirmed JE cases that occurred between 1966 and 2012 were analyzed using a mandatory notification system managed by the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. A total of 6,594 randomly-sampled serum specimens obtained in a nationwide population-based survey in 2002 were analyzed to estimate the seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies in the general population. The average annual JE incidence rate of the group aged 30 years and older was 0.167 cases per 100,000 people between 2001 and 2012, which was higher than the 0.052 cases per 100,000 people among those aged under 30 years. These seroepidemiological findings indicate that the cohort born between 1963 and 1975, who generally received two or three doses of the vaccine and were administered the last booster dose more than 20 years ago, exhibited the lowest positive rate of JE-neutralizing antibodies (54%). The highest and second highest antibody rates were observed, respectively, in the oldest unvaccinated cohort (86%) and in the youngest cohort born between 1981 and 1986, who received four doses 10-15 years ago (74%). Conclusion/Significance: Over the past decade, the main age group of the confirmed JE cases in Taiwan shifted from young children to adults over 30 years of age. People who were born between 1963 and 1975 exhibited the lowest seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the key issue for JE control in Taiwan is to reduce adult JE cases through a cost-effective analysis of various immunization strategies."	1040	"The Incidence of Japanese Encephalitis in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study"	"The Incidence of Japanese Encephalitis in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study | Background: A mass Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination program targeting children was launched in Taiwan in 1968, and the number of pediatric JE cases substantially decreased thereafter.

"PURPOSE: Akabane disease characterized mainly by fetal damage is a ruminant disease caused by insect-transmitted Akabane virus infection. METHODS: We investigated Akabane disease using serum neutralization tests in 446 blood samples collected from 187 cattle and 259 sheep of Xinjiang province, northwest China. RESULTS: (1) The overall prevalence rate of neutralizing antibody was 19.06 % (85/446), (2) the prevalence rates of Akabane disease in cattle and sheep were 20.32 % (38/187) and 18.15 % (47/259), respectively, (3) the disease prevalence rates were not significantly different between cattle and sheep, but significantly different among samples collected from different sampling months, (4) the disease was most prevalent in July when mosquitoes and culicoides were most active, and (5) the disease prevalence rates were significantly different between individuals with abortion experience and without abortion experience (P < 0.05), suggesting that Akabane virus infection may significantly increase abortion risk in cattle and sheep. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report confirming that Akabane virus infection is common in cattle and sheep of Xinjiang province, northwest China and providing useful epidemiological information for cattle and sheep abortion prevention and control."	1042	"A serological survey of Akabane virus infection in cattle and sheep in northwest China"	"A serological survey of Akabane virus infection in cattle and sheep in northwest China | PURPOSE: Akabane disease characterized mainly by fetal damage is a ruminant disease caused by insect-transmitted Akabane virus infection.

"Background: Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-transmitted virus, which causes bluetongue disease (BT) in sheep and a fatal hemorrhagic infection in North American white-tailed deer. However, in cattle the disease is typically asymptomatic and no overt clinical signs of disease appear to be associated with BTV infection. Serological evidence and isolation of different BTV serotypes have been reported in Sudan, however, no information is currently available in regard to previous exposure of Sudanese livestock to BTV infection in East Darfur State, Sudan. Aims: To determine the prevalence of BTV antibodies and to identify the potential risk factors associated with BTV infection among cattle in East Darfur State, Sudan. Methods: A total of 224 blood samples were collected randomly from five localities in East Darfur State, Sudan. The serum samples were screened for detection of BTV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results: Serological evidence of BTV infection was observed in 150 out of 224 animals accounting for a 67% prevalence rate among cattle in East Darfur State. Older cattle (>2 years of age) were six times more likely to be infected with BTV (OR=6.62, CI=2.87-15.26, p-value=0.01). Regarding animal source (contact with other herds) as a risk factor, it was shown that cattle purchased from market or introduced from other herds were 3 times at higher risk of being infected with BTV (OR=3.87, CI=1.07-13.87, p value=0.03). Exposure of cattle to the insect vector increased the risk of contracting BTV infection by six times compared to non-exposed cattle (OR=6.44, CI=1.53-27.08, p value=0.01). Conclusion: The present study indicated that age, animal source and the intensity of the insect vector are influential risk factors for BTV infection in cattle in the Darfur region. Surveillance for BTV infection should be extended to include other susceptible ruminants and to study the distribution of the insect vectors to better predict and respond to a possible BTV outbreak in the State of East Darfur, Sudan."	1043	"Prevalence of bluetongue virus antibodies and associated risk factors among cattle in East Darfur State, Western Sudan"	"Prevalence of bluetongue virus antibodies and associated risk factors among cattle in East Darfur State, Western Sudan | Background: Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-transmitted virus, which causes bluetongue disease (BT) in sheep and a fatal hemorrhagic infection in North American white-tailed deer.

"To investigate the possible circulation of arboviruses in South Korea, nationwide surveillance of five arbovirues was conducted in sentinel calves during 2009-2012. We used serum neutralization tests to investigate the presence of antibodies for the Aino virus, Akabane virus, bovine ephemeral fever virus, Chuzan virus and Ibaraki virus. In 2009, 2011 and 2012, the seropositive rates for these five arboviruses were all less than 14.1%. In 2010, however, the seropositive rates for Aino virus and Akabane virus were 33.2% and 40.2%, respectively. High seropositive rates were also associated with a large-scale outbreak of Akabane viral encephalomyelitis in cattle in southern Korea in 2010. Continued seroprevalence surveillance will be useful for monitoring natural arboviral diseases."	1044	"Seroprevalence of five arboviruses in sentinel cattle as part of nationwide surveillance in South Korea, 2009-2012"	"Seroprevalence of five arboviruses in sentinel cattle as part of nationwide surveillance in South Korea, 2009-2012 | To investigate the possible circulation of arboviruses in South Korea, nationwide surveillance of five arbovirues was conducted in sentinel calves during 2009-2012.

"Introduction: During summer 2010, 262 human cases including 35 deaths from West Nile virus (WNV) infection were reported from Central Macedonia, Greece. Evidence from mosquitoes, birds and blood donors demonstrated that the epidemic was caused by WNV lineage 2, which until recently was considered of low virulence. We conducted a household seroprevalence study to estimate the spread of infection in the population during the epidemic, ascertain the relationship of infection to clinical disease, and identify risk factors for infection. Methods: We used a two-stage cluster design to select a random sample of residents aged >= 18 years in the outbreak epicentre. We collected demographic, medical, and risk factor data using standard questionnaires and environmental checklists, and tested serum samples for presence of WNV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISA. Results: Overall, 723 individuals participated in the study, and 644 blood samples were available. Weighted seropositivity for IgG antibodies was 5.8% (95% CI: 3.8-8.6; n=41). We estimated that about 1 in 130 (1: 141 to 1: 124) infected individuals developed WNV neuroinvasive disease, and approximately 18% had clinical manifestations attributable to their infection. Risk factors for infection reflected high exposure to mosquitoes; rural residents were particularly at risk (prevalence ratio: 8.2, 95% CI: 1.1-58.7). Discussion: This study adds to the evidence that WNV lineage 2 strains can cause significant illness, demonstrating ratios of infection to clinical disease similar to those found previously for WNV lineage 1."	1046	"Population Seroprevalence Study after a West Nile Virus Lineage 2 Epidemic, Greece, 2010"	"Population Seroprevalence Study after a West Nile Virus Lineage 2 Epidemic, Greece, 2010 | Introduction: During summer 2010, 262 human cases including 35 deaths from West Nile virus (WNV) infection were reported from Central Macedonia, Greece.

In this study, a total of 95 bird serum samples from 14 species and 341 horse serum samples were collected from 2008 to 2010 in Shanghai, China. All serum samples were screened initially for WNV-reactive antibodies using a competitive ELISA. The positive samples detected by ELISA were further confirmed using a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for WNV and its most closely related flaviviruses in the area to avoid false positives due to cross-reactivity. Five (5.3%) of the bird serum samples and none (0.0%) of the horse serum samples tested positive for WNV antibodies. The findings strongly suggest that some of the birds, specifically the resident birds in China, had been exposed to WNV."	1048	"Serological investigations on West Nile virus in birds and horses in Shanghai, China"	"Serological investigations on West Nile virus in birds and horses in Shanghai, China | West Nile virus (WNV) infection is an emerging zoonosis that threatens global public health.

"Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is caused by the arthropod-borne bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), which is classified in the family Rhabdoviridae and the genus Ephemerovirus. A debilitating and sometimes fatal viral disease, BEF affects cattle and water buffalo. The epizootiology of BEF among cattle in China has not been fully determined. We examined the seroprevalence of the BEFV among cattle in China between January 2012 and June 2014. Among the 2822 serum samples collected from various cattle breeds in 26 provinces in China, the seropositive rate for the BEFV ranged from 0% to 81% between regions and species.
