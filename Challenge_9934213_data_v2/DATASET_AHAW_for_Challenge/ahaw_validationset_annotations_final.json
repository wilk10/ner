Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, multicentre study was performed on 174 feline samples [138 owned and 36 shelter-feral, including both healthy (43) and non-healthy (131), cats] from private veterinary clinics from all six districts of Cyprus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" (CMt). The population was tested for four FVBP including Bartonella henselae and Leishmania spp. using qPCR, while conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Serological assays were performed to detect Leishmania infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed to test associations and possible risk factors between variables and infectious agents. Results: Ninety-six (55.2%) of the 174 cats were PCR-positive for at least one infectious agent. Forty-six cats (26.4%) were haemoplasma positive, including 13 (7.5%) for Mhf, 36 (20.7%) for CMhm and 12 (6.9%) for CMt. Sixty-six cats (37.9%) were positive for Hepatozoon spp., while 19 (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae, four (2.3%) for Leishmania spp. and one (0.6%) for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Sequencing revealed the presence of Hepatozoon felis, L. infantum and Anaplasma platys. Of the 164 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 10 (6.1%) were FeLV-positive and 31 (18.9%) were FIV-positive, while L. infantum serology was positive in 7 (4.4%) of the 160 cats tested. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significant associations for various infectious agents including L. infantum with each of Hepatozoon spp. and CMt infection. Conclusions: A high prevalence of infectious agents was found in cats from Cyprus with Mhf, CMhm, CMt, L. infantum, B. henselae, H. felis, A. platys, FeLV and FIV infections reported for the first time.

The population was tested for four FVBP including Bartonella henselae and Leishmania spp. using qPCR, while conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Serological assays were performed to detect Leishmania infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed to test associations and possible risk factors between variables and infectious agents. Results: Ninety-six (55.2%) of the 174 cats were PCR-positive for at least one infectious agent. Forty-six cats (26.4%) were haemoplasma positive, including 13 (7.5%) for Mhf, 36 (20.7%) for CMhm and 12 (6.9%) for CMt. Sixty-six cats (37.9%) were positive for Hepatozoon spp., while 19 (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae, four (2.3%) for Leishmania spp. and one (0.6%) for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Sequencing revealed the presence of Hepatozoon felis, L. infantum and Anaplasma platys. Of the 164 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 10 (6.1%) were FeLV-positive and 31 (18.9%) were FIV-positive, while L. infantum serology was positive in 7 (4.4%) of the 160 cats tested. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significant associations for various infectious agents including L. infantum with each of Hepatozoon spp. and CMt infection. Conclusions: A high prevalence of infectious agents was found in cats from Cyprus with Mhf, CMhm, CMt, L. infantum, B. henselae, H. felis, A. platys, FeLV and FIV infections reported for the first time. The significant associations between different pathogens provide a better understanding of similarities in the epidemiology of these pathogens and interactions between them.

We report here results of both serological and molecular prevalence studies for major CVBDs of dogs from all over the South Korean Peninsula except for Jeju Island. Results: Serological survey of 532 outdoor dogs revealed the highest prevalence for Dirofilaria immitis (25.2%), followed by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (15.6%), Ehrlichia canis (4.7%) whereas Borrelia burgdorferi showed the lowest prevalence (1.1%). The number of serologically positive dogs for any of the four pathogens was 216 (40.6%). Concurrent real-time PCR assay of 440 dogs in the study indicated that DNA of â€œCandidatus M. haematoparvumâ€, Mycoplasma haemocanis, Babesia gibsoni, A. phagocytophilum, and Hepatozoon canis was identified in 190 (43.2%), 168 (38.2%), 23 (5.2%), 10 (2.3%) and 1 (0.2%) dogs, respectively.

Analysis of questionnaires collected from owners of 440 dogs showed that the number of dogs with heartworm preventive medication was 348 (79.1%) among which dogs still positive to D. immitis infection were 60 (17.2%), probably due to the mean months of heartworm preventive medication being only 6.5.

Conclusions: This study showed that the risk of exposure to major vector-borne diseases in dogs is quite high throughout all areas of South Korean Peninsula. Since achieving full elimination of many pathogens causing CVBDs from infected animals is often impossible even when they are clinically cured, dogs once exposed to CVBDs can remain as lifetime reservoirs of disease for both other animals and humans in the close vicinity, and should therefore be treated with preventative medications to minimise the risk of pathogen transmission by the competent vectors.

Dogs have been a human companion for millennia, and their significant impact on human life renders disease in dogs to be of great concern. Tick-borne diseases in dogs represent a substantial diagnostic challenge for veterinarians in that clinical signs are often diffuse and overlapping. In addition, co-infections with two or more pathogens enhance this problem further. Molecular methods are useful to disentangle co-infections and to accurately describe prevalence and geographical distribution of tick-borne diseases. At this point, this information is lacking in many areas worldwide. Romania is one such area, where prevalence and distribution of several important pathogens need to be further investigated. To address this, we screened blood samples from 96 sick dogs with molecular methods for eight different pathogens including Babesia spp., Theileria spp., Hepatozoon spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., \"Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis\", Mycoplasma spp., and Borrelia spp. Results: As many as 45% (43/96) of the dogs in the study were infected with protozoan parasites. Babesia canis was the most frequent of these (28 infected dogs), whereas Hepatozoon canis was detected in 15% (14/96) and Babesia gibsoni was found in a single sample.

Therefore, the implementation of surveillance and control measures is imperative to prevent the spread of the disease among the canine population as well as transmission to the human population."},"results":{"annotations":[{"start":59,"end":81,"tag":"Location "},{"start":180,"end":227,"tag":"Location "},{"start":344,"end":349,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":354,"end":359,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":369,"end":413,"tag":"Location "},{"start":421,"end":439,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":515,"end":529,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":656,"end":659,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":707,"end":715,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":661,"end":674,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":791,"end":811,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":988,"end":1003,"tag":"Location "},{"start":1133,"end":1150,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":1182,"end":1198,"tag":"Target_species"}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Refid":81882,"Author":" D.F.

Four samples were PCR positive and were subjected to a second PCR allowing parasite identification after DNA sequencing: two samples were identified as Leishmania donovani/infantum complex and Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis, respectively. Epidemiological information was obtained with a questionnaire: no correlation was found for the number of holiday trips within the previous 6months, but a significant risk of exposure to Leishmania spp. was found for travel to the New World, particularly to the Caribbean.

During 2012â€“2013, sand flies were surveyed using CDC miniature light-traps in 13 of 20 counties in Extremadura. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA by kDNA, ITS-1 and cyt-B. In addition, blood meals origins were analyzed by a PCR based in vertebrate cyt b gene. A total of 1083 sand flies of both gender were captured and identified. Five species were collected, Phlebotomus perniciosus (60.76%), Sergentomyia minuta (29.92%), P. ariasi (7.11%), P. papatasi (1.48%) and P. sergenti (0.74%). The last three species constitute the first report in Badajoz, the most southern province of Extremadura region.

The simultaneous presence of P. perniciosus and P. ariasi vectors, the analysis of blood meals, together with the detection of L. infantum and in S. minuta of L. tarentolae, confirms the ideal conditions for the transmission of this parasitosis in the western of Spain.

This study has demonstrated autochthonous arboviral circulations in the republic of Djibouti, and provides an epidemiological inventory, with useful findings for risk mapping and future prevention and control programs."},"results":{"annotations":[{"start":2,"end":28,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":32,"end":48,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":52,"end":60,"tag":"Location"},{"start":62,"end":76,"tag":"Location"},{"start":79,"end":99,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":137,"end":157,"tag":"Location"},{"start":439,"end":444,"tag":"Year"},{"start":456,"end":461,"tag":"Year"},{"start":468,"end":481,"tag":"Location"},{"start":482,"end":500,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":504,"end":525,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":530,"end":584,"tag":"AnMethod"},{"start":746,"end":758,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":760,"end":765,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":919,"end":935,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":978,"end":990,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":991,"end":995,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":1034,"end":1040,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1115,"end":1126,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1180,"end":1195,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1213,"end":1217,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":1299,"end":1315,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":1339,"end":1362,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1367,"end":1371,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":1467,"end":1490,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1492,"end":1496,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":1579,"end":1603,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":2042,"end":2062,"tag":"Location"}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Refid":1031,"Author":" H.

Our study provides key information for CCHF surveillance and raises awareness for possible imported cases in CCHF non-endemic countries."},"results":{"annotations":[{"start":14,"end":51,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":75,"end":84,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":89,"end":94,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":98,"end":104,"tag":"Location"},{"start":107,"end":145,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":255,"end":261,"tag":"Location"},{"start":291,"end":295,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":392,"end":396,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":400,"end":406,"tag":"Location"},{"start":418,"end":422,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":556,"end":560,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":750,"end":753,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":767,"end":770,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":776,"end":778,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":786,"end":788,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":798,"end":799,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":1058,"end":1061,"tag":"Prevalence"},{"start":771,"end":774,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":779,"end":784,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":789,"end":793,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":800,"end":807,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":843,"end":849,"tag":"Location"},{"start":935,"end":939,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":908,"end":915,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":1028,"end":1032,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1062,"end":1066,"tag":"Target_species"},{"start":1087,"end":1091,"tag":"Year"},{"start":1096,"end":1100,"tag":"Year"},{"start":1116,"end":1121,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1234,"end":1238,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1287,"end":1291,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1439,"end":1443,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1509,"end":1513,"tag":"Pathogenic_organisms"},{"start":1253,"end":1259,"tag":"Location"},{"start":1142,"end":1146,"tag":"Year"},{"start":1131,"end":1136,"tag":"Target_species"}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Refid":1037,"Author":" F.

A new arthropod-borne virus, called Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was identified as the cause of these losses. Blood samples were obtained from 40 goat flocks and tested for antibodies against SBV by ELISA, with 95% being seropositive. The calculated intra-herd seroprevalence (median 36.7%, min-max 0-93.3%) was smaller than in cattle or sheep flocks. Only 25% of the farmers reported malformations in kids. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of goats housed indoors all year-round to be infected by SBV than for goats kept outside day and night. The low intra-herd seroprevalence demonstrates that German goat flocks are still at risk of SBV infection. Therefore, they must be protected during the next lambing seasons by rescheduling the mating period, implementing indoor housing, and continuous treatment with repellents or vaccination."},"content":"Survey of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection in German goat flocks | Animal losses due to abortion and malformed offspring during the lambing period 2011/2012 amounted to 50% in ruminants in Europe.
