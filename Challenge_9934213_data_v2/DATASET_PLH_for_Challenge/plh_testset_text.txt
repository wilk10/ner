1134	G. Lobinger and U. Skatulla	"Studies on the survivability and development of gypsy moth larvae of two different origins, Lymantria dispar L. (Lep.: Lymantriidae) as a function of the host plant"	"The polyphagous gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is able to feed on about 400 different woody plant species. In general, oak species are preferred-on the other hand some other groups of plants are avoided on account of the presence of toxic substances. These unfavoured hosts are, for example, most of the Papilionaceae, like locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). We compared survival rate and development of two populations of different origin with long-term habituation to oak and locust, respectively. Larvae from the population habituated to oak proved unable to develop on locust food. There must be a lack of detoxification systems to modify the toxic alcaloids and flavenoids produced by Robinia pseudoacacia. On the other hand, larvae isolated from an locust stand were able to feed on oak leaves without problems in larval development or eclosion of adults. Gypsy moth larvae specialized on locust as host showed increased mortality (up to 27%) in the early larval instars, but the surviving animals, especially female individuals, reached significantly higher pupal weights and showed better fecundity: 40% higher egg numbers/egg mass compared to those feeding on oak. These results indicate that the gypsy moth population originating from the locust forest had achieved a high level of metabolic adaptation to this host plant and formed a 'biotype' of Lymantria dispar with optimal reproductive conditions in this special habitat."
232	V. V. Martynov and T. V. Nikulina	New invasive phytophagous insects in woods and forest plantings of Donbass	"The article presents information about 19 species of invasive phytophagous insects which were registered during the last 20 years on the territory of Donbass. Three species (Trichoferus campestris, Xyleborinus attenuatus and Anisandrus maiche) belong to the group of specialized xylophages, which can damage physiologically weakened trees and be technical pests. Monophagous and oligophagous species represent a larger group of invaders. Four species were associated with Robinia pseudoacacia: Obolodiplosis robiniae, Phyllonorycter robiniella, Parectopa robiniella and Nematus tibialis; two species with Gleditsia triacanthos: Dasineura gleditchiae and Megabruchidius dorsalis. Only one invasive species (Phloeosinus aubei) was found on the Cupressaceae plants (Juniperus virginiana, J. sabina, Thuja occidentalis). Pityogenes bistridentatus was associated with Pinus nigra pallasiana, Leptoglossus occidentalis with Pinus sylvestris, Exechesops foliatus with Acer tataricum and A. ginnala, Acanthoscelides pallidipennis with Amorpha sp., Monarthropalpus flavus with Buxus sempervirens, Lignyodes bischoffi with Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Bruchophagus sophorae with Sophora japonica, Cameraria ohridella with Aesculus hippocastanum, Aproceros leucopoda with Ulmus pumila. It was found, that neighboring invaders from European, Caucasian and Mediterranean fauna, which previously were limited by the range of host-plants are the main invasive phytophagous insects in forest plantations of Donbass in the end of the XX century. Distant invaders, which were transferred from North America (8 species), Southeast Asia (3 species) and Far East (3 species) form the faunistic basis of contemporary complex of invaders."
1140	T. Degomez and M. R. Wagner	Arthropod diversity of exotic vs. native Robinia species in northern Arizona	"Arthropods were collected on native locust, Robinia neomexicana A. Gray, and exotic Robinia pseudoacacia L. in northern Arizona over a 2-year period to determine the number of arthropod species and number of individuals present. 2 More arthropod species were found on the native (251) than on the exotic Robinia (174). 3 Greater species diversity was likewise found on the native than the exotic. The five most numerous insects collected each year accounted for 81% to 91% of the total number collected on the exotic and native Robinia in 1997 and 1998. Only 12 species occurred on both the native and exotic Robinia in both years. 4 These findings are discussed in the context of using exotic trees in plantations and ecological theory regarding rates of arthropod species accumulation on exotic hosts."
1803	E. I. Kuznetsova and N. K. Neupokoeva	The protection of tree and shrub species	"Laboratory investigations in the Rostov region of the USSR in 1976-77 revealed the presence there of 31 species of insect pests and 36 diseases of ornamental trees and shrubs. Young plants of sweet briar [Rosa] were infested by Allantus cinctus (L.), various trees by Aporia crataegi (L.) and Euproctis similis (Fuessly), and Prunus species by Malacosoma neustria (L.), but the most injurious pests of all were mole-crickets [Gryllotalpa] in nurseries of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, various aphids on Robinia pseudacacia, privet [Ligustrum vulgare], young rooted seedlings of Ribes aureum and other plants, and Lymantria dispar (L.) on seedlings of lime [Tilia] and sweet briar. In 1977, considerable damage was caused by larvae of Loxostege sticticalis (L.) to seedlings of sweet briar, lime and Sorbus in the Rostov area. Older seedlings were subject to a variety of stem-feeding pests. Control measures are discussed. Poisoned baits are effective against Gryllotalpa, sprays of biochemical preparations against some of the larval pests, with or without the addition of small additions of chemical insecticides such as trichlorphon (chlorophos), and chlorophos alone against others such as L. sticticalis. The control of diseases is separately discussed, but no combined measures against the 2 kinds of pests are mentioned."
1422	"V. K. Gupta, S. Sunita and L. N. Bhardwaj"	Management of fusarial wilt of black locust	"Two experiments are reported on the use of cultural practices to control wilt caused by Fusarium (F. oxysporum, F. equiseti and F. semitectum [F. pallidoroseum]) on Robinia pseudoacacia in Himachal Pradesh. In the first, sterilized mustard [?Brassica napus], soyabean [Glycine max] and cotton [Gossypium] oilseed cakes, pine [Pinus] needles and wheat [Triticum] straw were mixed with soil at 2.5% (oilseed cakes) or 3.5% (other amendments) in pots which were inoculated with Fusarium and then planted with 1-month-old seedlings. Disease incidence recorded after 45 days was reduced by all the amendments except for pine needles. Cotton cake was the best for reducing infection by F. oxysporum, mustard cake and wheat straw against F. equiseti, and wheat straw against F. semitectum. In the second experiment, radishes [Raphanus sativus], sarson [Brassica napus], carrots [Daucus carota] and gram [Vigna] were sown in pots and grown for one season (October 1989 to January 1990) and then tree seedlings were transplanted to the same pots and inoculated with Fusarium. Different watering schedules were applied, and disease incidence was recorded after 30-60 days. Disease incidence was least in the radish pots for F. oxysporum, the carrot pots for F. equiseti, and the mustard pot for F. semitectum. Plants watered daily developed more disease than those watered less frequently."
1428	"C. Sidor, I. Jodal and L. Dusanic"	Microbial diseases of gypsy moth (Porthetria dispar) in black locust forest	"Microsporidia (Nosema serbica, Nosema sp.) and viruses (Baculo-viruses) were found in gypsy moth egg caterpillars, i.e. before their hatching. These pathogens which cause the diseases were represented by different intensity in the gypsy moth caterpillars during their nutrition, as well, what gave rise to the appearance of the disease and led to the decrease in a number of caterpillars mostly in older stages. The disease was also observed both in pupae and moths in the period of several years and it resulted in a decrease of gypsy moth population to a such degree that this insect pest was very rare and even could hardly been found in 1990 and 1991 in \Bagremara\"" - a forest where it lives on Robinia leaves."""

Michalski"	"First record of Pulvinaria regalis CANARD, 1968 (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Coccidae) in Poland"	"Pulvinaria regalis has been recorded for the first time in Poland. This species was observed in large numbers on Acer pseudoplatanu, A. platanoides, Aesculus hippocastanum, Robinia pseudacacia, Tilia x euchlora and T. cordata in urban areas. Basic diagnostic information for this species and a key to separate the species of Pulvinaria recorded in Poland is provided. Aspects of the distribution, biology and economic importance of P. regalis are also discussed."

La Clair"	Laetirobin from the Parasitic Growth of Laetiporus sulphureus on Robinia pseudoacacia	"(+/-)-Laetirobin (1) was isolated as a cytostatic lead from Laetiporus sulphureus growing parasitically on the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia, by virtue of a reverse-immunoaffinity system. Using an LC/MS procedure, milligram quantities of (+/-)-laetirobin (1) were obtained, and the structure of 1 was elucidated by X-ray crystallography and confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Preliminary cellular studies indicated that (+/-)-laetirobin (1) rapidly enters in tumor cells, blocks cell division at a late stage of mitosis, and invokes apoptosis."
400	"M. Mrdakovic, B. Stojkovic, L. Ilijin, M. Vlahovic, V. Peric-Mataruga and J. Lazarevic"	TESTING THE ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY OF GYPSY MOTH DIGESTIVE ENZYMES IN RESPONSE TO TANNIC ACID USING PHENOTYPIC SELECTION ANALYSIS	"The adaptive significance of plasticity of digestive enzyme responses to allelochemical stress was tested on 32 full-sib gypsy moth families from an oak forest (the Quercus population) and 26 families from a locust-tree forest (the Robinia population), reared on control or tannic acid-supplemented diets. By using the relative growth rate as a fitness measure in phenotypic selection analyses, we revealed that higher specific activity of leucine aminopeptidase in Quercus larvae and lower specific activity of trypsin in Robinia larvae were adaptive in the control environment. In Quercus larvae, elevated specific activities of leucine aminopeptidase and lipase were adaptive in the stressful environment. There were no plasticity costs for the enzyme activities in either experimental group. The obtained results suggest that adaptive plasticity of digestive enzyme activity in gypsy moth larvae contributes to optimal growth rate under various environmental conditions."

Tian"	Diagnostics and Detection of Different Groups Phytoplasmas in China Using an Oligonucleotide Microarray on the Platform of ArrayTube	"[Objective] To find the optimal specific probe and develop the detection technique using oligonucleotide microarray on the platform of ArrayTube to detect and identify the phytoplasmas associated with plant disease in China. [Method] PCR amplification and microarray hybridization were used to detect 15 symptomatic plants probablyinfected with phytoplasma and asymptomatic plants as healthy controls collected from different regions in China. [Result] Phytoplasma 16S rDNA were detected in 13 of 15 symptomatic plants but not in all the healthy controls. Thirteen phytoplasmas were classified into 16Sr I, 16Sr II, 16Sr V and 16Sr XIX groups. Among 17 tested probes, the universal probe designated Pp-502 could be used to detect all phytoplasmas associated with plant disease. The specific probe designated Pp I-465 for 16Sr I group could be used to detect four phytoplasma strains of 16Sr I group associated with paulownia witches' -broom, chinaberry witches ' -broom, mulberry dwarf and lettuce yellows. The probe Pp II-629 for 16Sr II could be used to detect three phytoplasma strains 16Sr II group associated with peanut witches' -broom, sweet potato witches' -broom and cleome witches' -broom. Three phytoplasma strains of 16Sr V associated with jujube witches ' -broom, cherry lethal yellows and Bischofia polycarpa witches broom and chestnut yellows crinkle phytoplasma of 16Sr XIX could also be detected by specific probes, but they showed obvious.cross hybridization with other group probes. Compared with PCR amplification, the sensitivity of microarray to detect phytoplasma in plant increased by 1000-fold. Phytoplasmas of 16SrI and 16SrV group respectively were detected in periwinkle with symptoms of phyllody and witches' -broom collected from Fujian province and Robinia hispida with symptom of witches ' -broom collected from Henan province. While no phytoplasma was detected in peony with symptom of yellowing collected from Beijing and willow with symptom of witches' broom collected from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. [Conclusion] The oligonucleotide microarray on the platform of ArrayTube could be used as a method to investigate phytoplasmas in China, and could provide a sound basis for the phytoplasma identification and classification."
1687	P. W. Talboys and M. K. Davies	Robinia stem canker	"Lesions developing on 2-yr old trees of R. pseudoacacia yielded isolates of Fusarium avenaceum and, less frequently, F. lateritium [Gibberella baccata]."
1075	"D. Rigling, P. Lawrenz, H. Blauenstein and U. Heiniger"	An experimental study of the effects of ozone on tree-Armillaria interactions	"The effect of ozone on Armillaria root diseases was investigated in open top chambers applying a gradient of four environmentally realistic ozone levels. Tree-Armillaria interactions studied included Picea abies-A. ostoyae (two host provenances-three fungal isolates), Pinus sylvestris-A. ostoyae, Castanea sativa-A. mellea, and Robinia pseudoacacia-A. mellea. Logistic regression analysis showed no significant effect of the ozone treatment on tree mortality for all tree-Armillaria interactions. A significant effect of host provenance and fungal isolate on tree mortality was found in the P. abies-A. ostoyae interactions. Seedling mortality was higher in the P. abies provenance from low-altitude compared to the high-altitude spruce and one A. ostoyae isolate killed significantly more seedlings than the other two isolates. Differences in virulence expression among the three A. ostoyae isolates were not related to rhizomorph production. The results suggest that the tree-Armillaria interactions studied do not respond very sensitively to elevated ozone exposure."
999	E. Olivella	Biology of two leafminers species of the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) in Catalonia (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)	"The species Phyllonorycter robiniella (Clemens, 1859) and Parectoparobiniella Clemens, 1863 have some similarities: they are native from the east of North America and have arrived to the Iberian Peninsula in recent times, they feed on leaves of the same host plant: the Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Nevertheless they have different biological cycles: the first one mines the underside of leaves and the second the upperside; Phyllonorycter robiniella is gregarious and pupates inside the mine and Parectopa robiniella is solitary and pupates in a cocoon outside of the mine. This communication provides information and images on the biology of both species. Also, the importance of these species and their \negative\"" influence on ecosystems will be evaluated."""

Thus, host plants of A. tenuimaculatus were 186 kinds in 42 families in total including 136 kinds of plants in 32 families from literatures. 50 plants in 19 families were newly recorded as host of A. tenuimaculatus in this study. A. tenuimaculatus was the most frequently visited to Juglans sinensis and Castanea crenata was the highest damaged plant. C. crenata, Robinia pseudoacacia, Malus sieboldii, J. sinensis, Quercus mongolica, and Q. aliena were considerably highly preferred host plant. However, A. tenuimaculatus never visited to Diospyros lotus, J. nigra, Fraxinus mandshurica, F. rhynchophylla, Pyracantha angustifolia, Paulownia coreana, and Celtis sinensis. Even the same host plant of A. tenuimaculatus, preference was different according to observed place and damage level was also different depending on observed place and time."
692	C. Hansson and E. Shevtsova	Three new species of Achrysocharoides Girault (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) parasitoids of Phyllonorycter spp. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on Acer platanoides and Robinia pseudoacacia	"Three new species of Achrysocharoides are described, one from northern Europe, A. platanoidae sp. nov., one from central Europe and the U. S. A., A. robiniae sp. nov., and one from the U. S. A., A. robinicolus sp. nov. The descriptions are based on material reared from microlepidopterans of the genus Phyllonorycter Hubner (Gracillariidae): A. platanoidae from P. platanoidella (Joannis) on Acer platanoides, and A. robiniae and A. robinicolus from P. robiniella (Clemens) on Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust). The new species are very similar to previously described species, A. platanoidae to A. acerianus (Askew), and A. robiniae and A. robinicolus to A. gahani (Miller), but they are shown here to differ from their sibling species both in biology and in external morphology. The host of A. robiniae and A. robinicolus, P. robiniella, is a serious pest on the black locust tree in Europe, and the descriptions with diagnoses of these two species, and their scientific names, introduced here will aid the biological control efforts of this pest."

Hickman"	Pathology	"In southern England and Wales many cases of Phytophthora root-killing were reported on sizeable trees, including P. cinnamomi on yew, P. citricola on yew and Robinia X hillieri (the first record on R. sp.), and P. cryptogea on Lawson cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) and yew. A mixed consignment of transplants from the Netherlands in Nov. showed symptoms of severe P. damage and P. cryptogea was isolated from samples of beech (Fagus) and sweet chestnut. Microsphaera platani was again present on London plane (Platanus X hispanica) in central London but was less severe than in 1983. Erwinia amylovora was isolated from fresh small bark lesions on the stems of 10 to 15-yr old whitebeam (Sorbus aria) in Aug., this providing the first confirmation of direct bark infection. Diplodia pinea was identified on dying shoots of an Austrian pine (Pinus nigra var. nigra) in Hants, only the 2nd record of this fungus acting as a probable pathogen, the first being in 1951. Common causes of injury in Scotland and northern England were extremes of climate and misuse of chemicals. Frequently recorded root pathogens were Heterobasidion annosum, Armillaria spp. and Meripilus giganteus. The occurrence of Pucciniastrum epilobii on common silver fir (Abies alba) is a new British record. A survey of the incidence of resin top caused by Peridermium pini on Scots pine in Thetford Forest indicated that /3 of the old trees in the main block could be given a useful life expectancy of at least 12 yr. Cumulative losses from Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) have increased from 8.7% in 1977 to 17.6% in plots monitored for regenerating suckers in southern England. All new infections in 1983 and 1984 were caused by the aggressive str. and none by the non-aggressive one. A trial evaluating Trichoderma as a curative and protective treatment on inoculated elms showed no significant differences between treated and untreated trees. Foliage browning and shoot death in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and other conifers during winter 1983-84 was apparently not caused by 'acid rain' but probably by alternating periods of mild and cold weather accompanied by strong winds."

The four country clubs were selected as survey sites; Tongdo Country Club and Youngwon Country Club in Gyeongnam, Daegu Country Club in Gyeongbuk, and Dongrae Benest Golf Club in Busan. We found that 60 species of 44 genera in 34 families of six orders from 88 species of 54 genera in 33 families of 22 orders surveyed. Most landscaping trees were damaged by less than two species of insect pests, but tree species such as Robinia pseudoacacia, Prunus leveilleana var. pendula, Castanea crenata, Quercus dentata, and Q. variabilis were damaged by more than five species of insects. Most insect species damaged below two tree species. However Adoretus tenuimaculatus(Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) damaged 67 tree species of 41 genera. The Coleoptera and Homoptera species were 36.4% and 36.3% of the total insect species, respectively.

PSV-R infected 14 of 24 species of plants in four families. The thermal inactivation point was 55-60 degreeC. The dilution end point was 10-4-10-5 and the longevity in vitro was 10 days. Aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch) transmitted the virus in a nonpersistent manner. Virus particles were spherical with 30 nm in diameter. An antiserum against PSV-R was produced with titers of 1:1 024 and 1:256 in microprecipition and gel diffusion tests, respectively. Serologically PSV-R was closely related to PSV-Mi, distantly related to PSV-E. The molecular weight of PSV-R coat protein is about 26 000 D. PSV-R has four main components of RNAs with a small RNAs."
1276	C. Buttner and M. Fuhrling	Diagnosis of plant viruses in forest trees and seeds	"Studies were made to detect viruses in hardwood seeds, nursery seedlings and forest trees in Germany. Immunocapture RT-PCR was used to show that cherry leaf roll nepovirus (CLRV) isolates and strains could be detected in Betula pendula by direct sequencing of their PCR products. The virus was readily found throughout the year in seeds, leaves, male flowers, leaf buds and the cortical tissue of young twigs collected from a CLRV-infected birch-tree. In other studies, serological methods, grafting and a modified immunocapture RT-PCR (IC-RT-PCR) were used to detect apple mosaic ilarvirus (AMV), brome mosaic bromovirus (BMV), CLRV, poplar mosaic carlavirus (PMV), robinia mosaic virus [peanut stunt cucumovirus (PSV)] and diverse tobamoviruses in deciduous trees in German forests and nurseries. A conserved primer pair technique was found to be reliable for detecting different isolates of CLRV in birch forest trees and strains of this virus from other hosts such as beech, walnut and petunia hybrids. PMV was readily detected in poplar leaves, with mosaic symptoms, using IC-RT-PCR. Some viruses were detected by ELISA, e.g. AMV in Betula sp. and Carpinus sp., BMV in Fagus sylvatica, PMV in Populus sp. and RMV in Robinia sp. Tobamoviruses were detected in Acer, Sorbus and Quercus by nucleic acid hybridisation and by grafting."

"During tissue culture of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), serious problems with plant-associated bacteria led to a reduction of propagation potential in several clones. Four dominant strains of plant-associated bacteria could be isolated and were assigned to the genera Acidovorax, Dyella, Microbacterium and Sphingomonas. Out of five essential oils tested, thyme and lemongrass oil at a concentration of 0.03% each and 0.015% of both oils in combination clearly inhibited the growth of these bacteria strains on bacteriologic medium. There were no significant differences in total bacterial population density when penicillin, thyme and lemongrass oil or thyme plus lemongrass oil were added to the plant propagation media. The use of lemongrass oil changed the proportion of dominant bacterial strains."

Galford	A trap for tree-inhabiting cerambycids	A paper trap designed in studies in Ohio for determining the species and numbers of cerambycids visiting trees was evaluated against Megacyllene robiniae (Forst.) on black locust [Robinia pseudacacia] and Enaphalodes rufulus (Hald.) on various oaks [Quercus spp.] under plantation and forest conditions in 1976-77. The results showed that the trap could be successfully used to capture the former species but required some modification for the latter. Several other cerambycid species were also captured in the trap.

Intraspecific variation in dietary breadth can influence important ecological and evolutionary processes, yet the mechanisms generating this variation are usually unknown. Maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts frequently infect insect herbivores, and many have been shown to mediate key ecological interactions. For polyphagous herbivores, infection with particular symbionts is often strongly correlated with feeding on particular plant species, suggesting that facultative symbionts might directly determine herbivore food plant specificity. However, previous tests of this hypothesis have returned inconsistent results, providing little empirical support for a causal relationship between facultative symbiont infection and dietary breadth. 2. Here, we investigate whether heritable facultative symbionts mediate dietary breadth in the polyphagous aphid, Aphis craccivora. We first determined that asexual clones of the aphid differ dramatically in performance across two leguminous food plants, locust and alfalfa, and could be considered biotypes with distinct ecological characteristics. The heritable symbiont Arsenophonus is strongly associated with locust-origin aphids. 3. We created experimental lines that share aphid genotypes but differed with respect to Arsenophonus infection status, and compared performance across three food plant species. Naturally Arsenophonus-infected clones performed 2-4x better on locust and up to 75% worse on two alternate plant species than uninfected controls, clearly demonstrating that Arsenophonus promotes specialization on locust. In both laboratory and field experiments, uninfected locust- and alfalfa-origin clones exhibited similar and modest performance on locust, indicating that the locust-associated biotype' would not exist without Arsenophonus. 4. We also hypothesized that moving Arsenophonus, via transinfection, to an alfalfa-origin lineage would improve performance on locust and serve to expand dietary breadth. Indeed, transinfection doubled aphid performance on locust and halved aphid performance on alfalfa. However, because this aphid lineage naturally performs better on alfalfa, the transinfected symbiont functionally equalized aphid performance between locust and alfalfa, making the alfalfa biotype more generalized. Thus, the same symbiont can either reduce or expand dietary breadth, depending on host genotype. 5. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that symbiont gain or loss can instantaneously and substantially change the topology of food plant use in a polyphagous insect, modifying diet in ways that potentially influence the insect's ecological niche, evolutionary trajectory and pest status."

Seemuller"	Phytoplasma diseases of trees and shrubs of urban areas in Europe	"In Europe, phytoplasmas cause severe yellows, witches'-broom and decline diseases of trees and shrubs grown in urban areas. Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) is affected by the spartium witches'-broom disease which is associated with phytoplasmas,of the apple proliferation (AP) and elm yellows (EY) groups. Broom (Sarothamnus scoparius) and buckthorn (Rhamnus catharticus) are affected by lethal witches'-broom diseases whose causal agents are distinct members of the AP group. An important disease of elm (Ulmus minor and others) is elm yellows, which is caused by the EY phytoplasma. Alder (Alnus glutinosa and others) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) are affected by alder yellows and eucalyptus little-leaf disease, respectively, both induced by phytoplasmas closely related to the EY agent. Yellows diseases associated with phytoplasmas of the aster yellows group affect several species of poplar including Populus nigra 'Italica', P. alba, and P. tremula. Ornamental apples (Malus spp.) and flowering cherry (Prunus serrulata) are affected by apple proliferation and European stone fruit yellows, respectively. Other trees and shrubs affected by phytoplasmoses include black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), hazel (Corylus maxima and C. colurna), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), hawthorn (Crataegus monogina) and weeping-willow (Salix babylonica). However, the identity of the phytoplasmas infecting these species has never been determined."

Polymorphism at each locus was tested on 68 individuals from six populations reared from infected host leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia L. collected in China. Fourteen loci were found to be polymorphic, with the number of alleles ranging from 3 to 10. The observed heterozygosity varied evenly from 0.2667 to 0.6540. For populations, the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.1429 to 1.000. The allele frequency of the predominant allele varied from 0.250 to 0.500. All loci with negative F-ST values indicated heterozygote excess in each locus with six populations. Of 14 loci, four were observed to have F-ST values up to 0.05, which indicated negligible genetic differentiation within the population. Significant deviations (P < 0.05) from the expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as evaluated using the Markov chain algorithm for each locus and for all six populations, were observed, and genotypic linkage disequilibrium was clearly detected. These markers represent a useful tool to design strategies for integrated pest management and in the study of population evolution in this important introduced pest."

Corydalis favula density, capsule and seed production, and composition and structure of the associated groundlayer and overstory, were recorded 18-26 May 1998 in six 5,600 m(2) plots. Corydalis favula plants were sparsely dispersed, averaging 1.4 plants/m(2) and 1.1% cover in all plots. Over 95% of C. favula plants produced flowers, and 89% produced seeds. Flowering plants produced an average of 4.0 capsules, each with an average of 3.8 seeds, and seed production averaged 15.1 seeds/flowering plant, and 19.9 seeds/m(2). Over 11% of plants were browsed by deer, foliage on 3.4% of plants showed insect feeding damage, and 3.7% of capsules showed external attack. Inside capsules, insect attack was more frequent, averaging 11%. The six stands where C. favula was monitored were relatively similar: young, second growth, disturbed forests, dominated by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and subdominated by black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.). Tree density ranged from approximately 750-1250 trees/ha, and dead trees were common, accounting for an additional 28% of all trees > 10 cm dbh. Corydalis favula presence was associated with shorter groundlayer vegetation (25 cm vs 29 cm) and lower groundlayer cover (96% vs 107%), and abundance was significantly higher in both quadrats and plots with low graminoid cover and high annual and biennial cover. Corydalis favula, like other woodland annuals, is disturbance adapted, and conditions that favor growth of woodland annuals also favor the growth of C. favula."
1127	M. Maceljski and A. Mesic	Phyllonorycter robiniella Clemens: A new insect pest in Croatia	"The black locust tree (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a common tree in Croatia. Its provenience is North America. The fast increase of the airborne traffic in the last decades of the 20th century made possible the introduction of some autochthonous insect pests of this trees from America to Europe. The aphid Appendiseta robiniella was found in Europe in 1978, in 1984 in Croatia and the miner Parectopa robiniella was discovered in Europe in 1970 and in Croatia in 1983. During the year 2001 we discovered the third insect pest of the black locust tree in Croatia - the miner Phyllonorycter robiniella. This insect was firstly discovered in Europe in 1983. Phyllonorycter robiniella is causing specific leaf mines on the leaf underside. These mines are oval shaped and silver coloured. In average they cover 1.4 cm2. They are easy distinguished from the mines caused by Parectopa robiniella: the mines of Phyllonorycter are on the leaf underside and are oval shaped and the mines caused by the last four instars of the Parectopa larvae are on the leaf upperside and are ramified. The moth overwinter. The first mines appear in June. The miner has 4-5 generations. The intensity of attack is fastly increasing during the year. It is expected that both moths could make substantial damage by affecting the growth especially of young trees, causing defoliation and a poor flowering, therefore negatively influencing the aesthetic role of these trees and the beekeepers."

[Methods] The damage on leaves of the black locust and the biology of these pests were studied in the field. [Results] Chrysaster ostensackenella was recorded for the first time in China in Shandong and Liaoning Provinces. The record reported here is the only validated record of this species outside its native North American range. In Yantai, Shandong Province, C. ostensackenella had four generations a year and attacked more than 80% of the leaflets of black locust trees, resulting in an accelerated abscission of leaves. In some of the more seriously infested stands, all trees, and more than 90% of leaflets were damaged. In addition, a congeneric species, C. hagicola, was newly recorded in China, and its biology studied. Morphological and diagnostic characters of the two pests are provided to assist precise identification and biological monitoring. [Conclusion] Both species of the genus Chrysaster Kumata are found in China, of which C. ostensackenella is an invasive pest that seriously threatens the black locust, R. pseudoacacia. Relevant control measures should be undertaken by afforestation and plant quarantine departments and intensive studies conducted to fully understand this invasive species."

The epizootics that can be produced with the virus were studied in Romanian oak and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) forests. Locust forests were the most favorable areas for the development of epizootics, producing mass mortality among the caterpillars during all stages of development. Populations of black locust trees can be considered natural reserves of polyhedrosis virus. Among oak forests, the Turkey oak (mossy oak) (Quercus cerris L.) are most favorable for setting up epizootics of adequate intensity among the caterpillars of L. dispar, especially in their early stages. The European or English oak (Q. robur and Q. pedunculata Ehrh.) are not favorable for epizootics. Concentrations of dead caterpillars at the base of trees indicates an epizootic and permits recovery of biologic material suitable for producing viral preparations suitable for future control of L. dispar."

The white berried mistletoes appear on 45 taxons (41 species, 2 cultivars and 2 hybrids). Of the 41 species, 31 are autochthonous and 10 are allochthonous. The hosts belong to 11 families, and all were recorded in the literature except for Alnus japonica and Prunus cerasifera. The autochthonous species which can be regarded as the common hosts are: Malus pumila, Populus nigra, Pyrus communis, Salix alba and Tilia cordata. The most common among the infested allochthonous species are: Acer saccharinum and Robinia pseudoacacia. The forest cultures of Juglans nigra and Robinia pseudoacacia and the culture of Populus canadensis, P. nigra and P. deltoides are often infested. The mistletoe spread in natural stands, forest cultures, parks, non-cultivated orchards, and on solitary trees of the verge of woods and in open areas in the northern and middle parts of the country. The species was not found in the mediterranean and sub-mediterranean regions, nor in the high mountain massifs separating the continental from the mediterranean and sub-mediterranean region. The distribution of mistletoe is mosaic-like, which is due to the mosaic-like distribution of hosts, local conditions, movements of birds and others.

Melika	DIVERSITY OF PARASITOID ASSEMBLAGES OF NATIVE AND ALIEN LEAF MINERS IN CROATIA	"Leaf miners support rich parasitoid assemblages and majority of these parasitoid specie; are generalists. Alien and invasive species are global problem and pose direct and indirect threat to ecosystem stability. Leafminers are very successfull invaders and they build up their populations soon after establishment in an new area. Invaders escape from their native parasitoids and have competitive advantage over native species in new area. Native parasitoids adapt to new host and new parasitoid assemblages are established. Croatia has rich native leafminer fauna with recently added alien and invasive species. Phyllonorycter roboris, Phyllonorycter quercifoliella, Tischeria ekebladella on Quercus robur and Q. petraea, Phyllonorycter klemannella on Alnus glutinosa are native leafminers. Phyllonorycter robiniella, Parectopa robinella on Robinia pseudoacacia, Phyllonorycter platani on Platanus sp., Cameraria ohridella on Aesculus hippocastanum and Phyllonorycter leucographella on Pyracantha coccinea are recently introduced invasive species in Croatia. In this research we tested the following hypotheses: a) native parasitoids have adapted to new hosts, b) these parasitoid species are generalists, c) native and alien species of leafminers with similar bioecological characteristics have similar parasitoid assemblages. The sites of research were chosen according to the host plant sites, in forests and parks in Croatia. The research was carried out from 2004-2006. Leaves with mines were collected and kept in glass containers in outside insectary until emergence of parasitoids. For each parasitoid assemblage the diversity indices were calculated: Domination index (D), Shannon's diversity index H and evenness of species E. Cluster analyses for comparison of similarities of parasitoid assemblages was done. In total, 28 taxa of parasitoids from the superfamily Chalcidoidea and 4 taxa from the superfamily of Ichneumonoidea have been found (Table 1). Table 1 shows domination index (D) for parasitoid species found for a host leaf miner. This research compares the parasitoid assemblages of different species of leafminers, the results have been obtained after mass rearings of parasitoids from different localities and different collection times and it does not give detailed insight into parasitism percentages and the seasonal distribution of parasitoid species within a parasitoid assemblage. Table 2 shows values of Shannon's diversity index H and evenness of species E, and Figure 1 shows dendrogram from cluster analyses grouping leaf miner species according to the similarities of their parasitoid assemblages. The majority of parasitoid species found are generalist species found on other species of leaf miners from the order Lepidoptera. P. roboris/P. quercifoliella have the most diverse parasitoid assemblage (the highest H value) (Table 2) followed by T. ekebladella. Oaks support rich fauna of taxonomicaly and ecologicaly similar leaf miner species and free exchange of parasitoids is enabled among them. All the parasitoid species found on these leafminers are generalist. They also have the highest E value (Table 2) because they lack specific monophagous parasitoid species. P. klemannella has lower diversity indices H and E because of the dominance of specific parasitoids from Encyrtidae family. P. platani has two dominant parasitoid species Minotetrastichus platanellus and Pediobius saulius. Dendrogram shows that P. roboris/P. quercifoliella, P. robiniella, P. leucographella, Pa. robiniella i T. ekebladella have similar parasitoid assemblages. Very similar are T. ekebladella and Pa. robiniella, both host species grow on the same sites together (oak and black locust) and generalists can search for similar mines: white upper surface leaf mines. The greater linkage distance between P. klemannella i P. platani can be explained with the dominance of specific monophagous parasitoid species in the assemblage. The similarities between parasitoid assemblages of native (P. roboris/P. quercifoliella, T. ekebladella) and alien (P. leucographella, P. robiniella, Pa. robiniella, C. ohridella) leaf miner species show that the native generalist parasitoids have adapted to new hosts. Ten species of parasitoids have been found on C. ohridella, with Pediobius saulius and Minotetrastichus frontalis as two dominant species (Table 1). This research has shown that invasive leaf miner species in Croatia have recruited a parasitoid community similar to the native leaf miner species and that this process has occurred quite rapidly."
720	R. Zemek and R. Socha	Habitat selection in the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus: Does it minimize the risk of being parasitized by the ectoparasitic mite Hemipteroseius adleri?	"The firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae) is a polyphage whose European populations mainly feed on the seeds of trees (Tilia cordata, T. platyphylos, Robinia pseudoacacia) or plants such as mallows (Malvaceae). It is frequently found on the ground near host trees or at the base of their trunks. During summer, however, we observed many individuals to climb up the trees. Movement of the bugs to upper parts of the trees and their occurrence in canopies have not been reported so far and there is also no clear explanation for this behavior. We formulated the hypothesis that P. apterus switches habitat to find optimal abiotic conditions for its development and to avoid the ectoparasitic mite Hemipteroseius adleri (Otopheidomenidae). To test this hypothesis we collected samples of adult males and females of the firebug from linden tree trunks at >1 m above the ground (tree habitat) and from the ground near these trees (ground habitat). The insects were individually preserved in vials with ethanol and examined using a microscope. Eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults of H. adleri found on each specimen were counted. The results revealed that the bugs dwelling on linden trees were nearly devoid of parasitic mites (only 5% were parasitized), whereas 29% of those collected on the ground were parasitized. The mean numbers of H. adleri found on the respective groups were clearly different. We also tested whether P. apterus is more likely to be infested by H. adleri during its final larval ecdysis. Laboratory experiments showed no differences between the infestation by the mite in adult bugs and adults emerged from the last instars. We conclude that selection of a tree habitat in P. apterus might contribute to reducing the risk of being parasitized by H. adleri."

Caterpillars originated from two populations (Quercus rubra or Robinia pseudoacacia forest) and were differently adapted to trophic stress, i.e. feeding on locust tree leaves - unsuitable host plant. The number of neurosecretory neurons was higher in the caterpillars originated from Robinia population than in Quercus population, regardless of feeding. A2 neurosecretory neurons, nuclei and their nucleoli were larger in caterpillars fed with unsuitable leaves in both populations. There was more aminergic product in the A2 neurosecretory neurons of the caterpillars fed with unsuitable leaves independently of population origin."

The regions most suitable for the pest are the oak forests of the southern plains and in the west, where climatic conditions are favourable. Accounts are given of three gradation cycles that occurred in different areas in 1953-60, 1961-67 and 1968-71, respectively; details of the factors involved and of the dates and places of the various phases are shown in tables. During the progression phase, 1000-Q1400 eggs are laid/female; fecundity falls to 50-150/female during the retrogression phase, and natural mortality factors such as parasites and diseases become more active. Chemical treatment with sprays containing DDT and BHC during these years indicated that defoliation could be prevented by these means but subsequent reinfestation could not. It was also observed that defoliation did not kill the infested oaks unless it was combined with other adverse factors."

The gall midges are associated with 95 host plant species. The average species number per individual locality (17 species, from 4 to 29) is relatively high. The number of gall midge species decreases with increasing altitude. The majority of species were found at one to three localities. The following species occur abundantly: Wachtliella rosarum on Rosa canina and related species of Rosa and Cystiphora taraxaci on Taraxacton officinale, A total of 78 species have european, 48 euro-siberian and 6 submediterranean distribution. Dasineura gleditchiae on Gleditschia triacanthos and Obolodiplosis robiniae on Robinia pseudoacacia are nearctic species which have been accidentally introduced from North America to Europe and were recorded in South Tyrol in 2004 for the first time. Galls of Janetiella oenephila on leaves of Vitis vinifera were also recorded for the first time in South Tyrol. A total of 15 gall midge species are associated with 13 alpine and subalpine host plant species. Dasineura spicatae (KIEFFER, 1909) is a valid name (not a synonym of Jaapiella veronicae) for a species which causes galls on Veronica spicata."

Susceptible vines die within a few years after infection. However, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not fully understood. It is very important to optimize the timing and positioning of inoculation in host plants to study the infection process. Rooted dormant cuttings of cv. Chardonnay (susceptible vine) were grouped as stem tissue hardening and shoot elongation for needle-inoculation with 20 mul of 2 x 108 cfu ml-1 of Xf suspension. The infected plants were sampled 2 and 3 weeks following postinoculation (wpi) at 10 cm above the point of inoculation. Negative controls were prepared with 5 plants from each group with water inoculation. DAS-ELISA was used to detect Xf. Plants with soft stem tissue were not well suited to needle inoculation due to their poorly hardened stems, and bacterial suspension could not be fully supplied to the tissue. However, ELISA worked well with both stem types. Chardonnay cuttings with gtoreq30 cm long semi-hardwood tissue, sampled 2 wpi, resulted in fast bacterial movement, while ELISA readings dramatically dropped 3 wpi. Samples from the apical end of inoculated shoots had low ELISA readings, likely the result of young xylem development."

The bacterium has been found to be transmitted in Brazil by sharpshooter leafhoppers (Cicadellidae). Sharpshooters are present in most citrus growing areas of the United States. The sharpshooter leafhopper; Oncometopia nigricans Walker, frequently is found feeding on citrus in Florida. This sharpshooter transmits the X. fastidiosa strains that cause Pierce's disease of grape and ragweed stunt; Research was initiated to determine if O. nigricans was capable of vectoring the X. fastidiosa that causes CVC. In 59 different transmission tests, using 1 to 57 insects per test, transmission of the bacterium was observed 12 times (20.3%). Symptom development in the greenhouse was not a reliable indicator of transmission. Transmission was verified by specific polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Individual insects were able to transmit the bacterium. This information on sharpshooter transmission of CVC is needed to assess the threat posed by the CVC disease to the citrus industries in the United States."

Riparian hosts that do not maintain sufficient X. fastidiosa populations for acquisition may not be significant inoculum reservoirs. We examined X. fastidiosa populations in systemically infected riparian hosts (California blackberry, California grapevine, elderberry, Himalayan blackberry, periwinkle) at two coastal locations (Mendocino and Napa) with two methods of quantitation (culturing and real-time polymerase chain reaction) from 2003 to 2004. In summer and autumn, X. fastidiosa populations were above the threshold for BGSS acquisition in periwinkle, Himalayan blackberry, and California grapevine at both locations. The only X. fastidiosa-positive plants detected in spring at both locations were periwinkle and Himalayan blackberry, suggesting that these species may contribute to long-term survival of X. fastidiosa. California blackberry and elderberry may not be important reservoirs of X. fastidiosa, given that very few plants of either species maintained infections. Higher X. fastidiosa populations in California grapevine, Himalayan blackberry, and periwinkle in Napa, relative to plants in Mendocino, may partially explain the higher PD incidence in Napa vineyards."

Grafting of scions from symptomatic almond trees onto seedlings of a local almond (cv. Mamaee) under greenhouse conditions resulted in the transmission of the leaf scorch agent. A number of symptomatic samples from orchard and greenhouse plants were positive for presence of Xylella fastidiosa when tested by DAS-ELISA and PCR with X. fastidiosa specific antibodies and primers. A Gram-negative bacterium similar to X. fastidiosa was isolated on 'periwinkle wilt' (PW) medium. Selected isolates induced symptoms similar to those caused by X. fastidiosa when inoculated on Nicotiana tabacum, seedlings of almond and grapevine under greenhouse conditions. DAS-ELISA and PCR confirmed the identity of the isolated bacteria. On the basis of disease symptoms, graft transmission, isolation on specific X. fastidiosa culture medium, pathogenicity tests and positive reactions in DAS-ELISA and PCR, X. fastidiosa is associated with almond leaf scorch and Pierce's disease in grapevine in Iran.

Purcell	Patterns of Xylella fastidiosa colonization on the precibarium of sharpshooter vectors relative to transmission to plants	"Patterns of Xylella fastidiosa colonization on the precibarium of sharpshooter vectors relative to transmission to plants | Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterial plant pathogen that causes many plant diseases, including Pierce's disease of grapevines. Sharpshooter leafhopper (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae) vectors transmit this bacterium to plants. Although the basic mechanism of pathogen transmission is not completely understood, previous studies implicated the foregut of infected insects as the source of bacterial inoculum because infective nymphs lose transmissibility after molting and no latent period is required for transmission. Scanning electron microscopy documented the spatial distribution of X. fastidiosa in the foreguts of the sharpshooter Graphocephala atropunctata (Signoret) after short (1-d) and long (4-d) acquisition access periods on infected plants and various inoculation access periods on grape test plants. After 1-d acquisition and 1-d inoculation periods, cells had only colonized portions of the precibarium between the stylets and the cibarial pump, often embedded in a matrix-like material. After long (15-d) periods after acquisition, we found bacterial cells attached polarly to the insect's cuticle in a regular pattern throughout the precibarium but absent from specific locations on both pharynges. Insects sampled for microscopy 2 wk after long acquisition access periods and that contained bacteria in their mouthparts transmitted X.fastidiosa to healthy grapevines independently of the length of the acquisition access period. In contrast, individuals free of bacteria on the precibarium did not transmit the pathogen. After successive short acquisition and inoculation periods, 5 of 12 X. fastidiosa-positive insects did not transmit to plants. We also did transmission experiments with the sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata; however, only one of 30 individuals had X. fastidiosa attached to its precibarium, and none transmitted it to plants. Our results suggest that sharpshooters introduce into plants X. fastidiosa cells that detach from the precibarial canal during feeding."

PD and ALS have long been considered to be caused by the same strain of this pathogen, but recent genetic studies have revealed differences among X. fastidiosa isolated from these host plants. We tested the hypothesis that ALS is caused by PD and ALS strains in the field and found that both groups of X. fastidiosa caused ALS and overwintered within almonds after mechanical inoculation. Under greenhouse conditions, all isolates caused AILS and all isolates from grapes caused PD. However, isolates belonging to almond genetic groupings did not cause PD in inoculated grapes but systemically infected grapes with lower frequency and populations than those belonging to grape strains. Isolates able to cause both PD and ALS developed 10-fold-higher concentrations of X. fastidiosa in grapes than in almonds. In the laboratory, isolates from grapes overwintered with higher efficiency in grapes than in almonds and isolates from almonds overwintered better in almonds than in grapes. We assigned strains from almonds into groups I and II on the basis of their genetic characteristics, growth on PD3 solid medium, and bacterial populations within inoculated grapevines. Our results show that genetically distinct strains from grapes and almonds differ in population behavior and pathogenicity in grapes and in the ability to grow on two different media."

CVC and CLS occur sympatrically and share leafhopper vectors; thus, determining whether X. fastidiosa isolates can be dispersed from one crop to another and cause disease is of epidemiological importance. We sought to clarify the genetic and biological relationships between CVC- and CLS-causing X. fastidiosa isolates. We used cross-inoculation bioassays and microsatellite and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches to determine the host range and genetic structure of 26 CVC and 20 CLS isolates collected from different regions in Brazil. Our results show that citrus and coffee X. fastidiosa isolates are biologically distinct. Cross-inoculation tests showed that isolates causing CVC and CLS in the field were able to colonize citrus and coffee plants, respectively, but not the other host, indicating biological isolation between the strains. The microsatellite analysis separated most X. fastidiosa populations tested on the basis of the host plant from which they were isolated. However, recombination among isolates was detected and a lack of congruency among phylogenetic trees was observed for the loci used in the MLST scheme. Altogether, our study indicates that CVC and CLS are caused by two biologically distinct strains of X. fastidiosa that have diverged but are genetically homogenized by frequent recombination."

All tobacco plants inoculated with a citrus strain of X. fastidiosa expressed unequivocal symptoms, consisting of orange leaf lesions, approximately 2 months after injection of the pathogen. CVC symptoms were observed in citrus 3 to 6 months after inoculation. The pathogen was readily detected in symptomatic tobacco plants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and phase contrast microscopy. In addition, X. fastidiosa was reisolated on agar plates in 4 of 10 plants. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of cross sections of stems and petioles revealed the presence of rod shaped bacteria restricted to the xylem of inoculated plants.

Also present in these crops and infesting weeds, which ultimately could serve as sources of inoculum for the cultivated trees, are diverse populations of xylem-feeding leafhopper vectors. In order to assess host range of X. fastidiosa among weeds and to better understand their role in epidemics, field surveys, mechanical inoculations, and insect transmission tests were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture plating were used to detect the pathogen from plant tissues. X. fastidiosa was detected in 10 out of 23 species of the weed plants sampled in two citrus groves affected by CVC. None of the weed plants showed external symptoms. In the greenhouse, the average percentages of infection on plants mechanically inoculated with the CVC, CLS, and PLS strains of X. fastidiosa were, respectively, 25, 10, 0 in Medicago sativa; 70, 45, 20 in Echinochloa crus-galli; 45, 30, 0 in Brachiaria decumbens; 72, 70, 40 in Brachiaria plantaginea; 13, 10, 0 in Digitaria horizontalis; 31, 30, 0 in Solanum americanum; and 17, 0, 0 in Bidens pilosa. Symptoms were observed only in S. americanum and citrus and only when inoculated with the CVC strain. In insect transmission tests, the grass leafhopper Ferrariana trivittata was first caged on citrus plants showing CVC symptoms and then on healthy citrus and on the four most common weeds. No plants tested positive by PCR or culture, or showed symptoms for at least 4 months after inoculation. The amount of X. fastidiosa cells that may accumulate in weeds inoculated by leafhoppers is probably under insect acquisition thresholds, a factor that would limit their importance to the CVC epidemics, as studies on spatial distribution of diseased citrus trees over time indicate."

For generalist pathogens, different pathogen strains, vector species, or host species may all contribute to variability in disease incidence. One such pathogen is Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al., a xylem-limited bacterium that infects dozens of crop, ornamental, and native plants in the USA. This pathogen also has a diverse vector complex and multiple biologically distinct strains. We studied the implications of diversity in this pathogen-vector-host system, by quantifying variability in transmission efficiency of different X. fastidiosa strains (isolates from almond and grape genetic groups) for different host plants (grape, almond, and alfalfa) by two of the most important vectors in California: glassy-winged sharpshooter [Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar)] and green sharpshooter (Draeculacephala minerva Ball) (both Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Transmission of isolates of the almond strain by H. vitripennis did not differ significantly, whereas transmission varied significantly among isolates from the grape strain (15-90%). Host plant species did not affect H. vitripennis transmission. Conversely, D. minerva efficiency was mediated by both host plant species and pathogen strain. No acquisition of an almond isolate occurred regardless of plant type (0/122), whereas acquisition of a grape isolate from alfalfa was 10-fold higher than from grape or almond plants. These results suggest that pathogen, vector, and host diversity impose contingencies on the transmission ecology of this complex disease system. Studies aimed at the development of management strategies for X. fastidiosa diseases should consider the complexity of these interactions as they relate to disease spread."

To this effect, diagnostic protocols based on ELISA and conventional PCR for X. fastidiosa detection in olive samples were compared and validated via an interlaboratory ring-test in which three accredited laboratories, all located in Italy, participated.

Knowledge of X. fastidiosa behaviour in the plant host under field conditions is important for disease control and this issue is being addressed in this project. Occurrence of ALSD is strongly influenced by environmental factors. In 2006, the earliest leaf scorching symptoms were observed in June, whereas in 2007, the earliest occurrence of leaf scorching symptoms was in July, a delay of 1 month. In both years, PCR detected X. fastidiosa 1 month before of symptom expression. PCR was slightly more sensitive than cultivation method for early bacterial detection. However, uneven bacterial distribution and random sampling errors may have contributed to the differences among the assays. Correlation between cultivation and PCR detection was greater than 90%. During the processing of a large number of samples, we noticed occasional failures in PCR amplifications of some samples, interfering result interpretation. We developed an array-PCR protocol using primers from seven housekeeping genes to correct the deficiency."

Hartung"	Citrus and coffee strains of Xylella fastidiosa induce Pierce's disease in grapevine	"Citrus and coffee strains of Xylella fastidiosa induce Pierce's disease in grapevine | Xylella fastidiosa causes citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) disease in Brazil and Pierce's disease of grapevines in the United States. Both of these diseases cause significant production problems in the respective industries. The recent establishment of the glassy-winged sharpshooter in California has radically increased the threat posed by Pierces disease to California viticulture. Populations of this insect reach very high levels in citrus groves in California and move from the orchards into the vineyards, where they acquire inoculum and spread Pierce's disease in the vineyards. Here we show that strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from diseased citrus and coffee in Brazil can incite symptoms of Pierce's disease after mechanical inoculation into seven commercial Vitis vinifera varieties grown in Brazil and California. Thus, any future introduction of the CVC strains of X. fastidiosa into the United States would pose a threat to both the sweet orange and grapevine industries. Previous work has clearly shown that the strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from Pierce's disease- and CVC-affected plants are the most distantly related of all strains in the diverse taxon X. fastidiosa. The ability of citrus strains of X. fastidiosa to incite disease in grapevine is therefore surprising and creates an experimental system with which to dissect mechanisms used by X.,fastidiosa in plant colonization and disease development using the full genome sequence data that has recently become available for both the citrus and grapevine strains of this pathogen."

Strains of the bacterium isolated from the two plant hosts are very closely related, and the two diseases share sharpshooter insect vectors. In order to determine if citrus strains of X. fastidiosa could infect coffee and induce CLS disease, plant inoculations were performed. Plants of coffee, Coffea arabica 'Mundo Novo', grafted on Coffea canephora var, robusta 'Apuatao 2258' were mechanically inoculated with triply cloned strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from diseased coffee and citrus. Three months postinoculation, 5 of the 10 plants inoculated with CLS-X. fastidiosa and 1 of the 10 plants inoculated with CVC-X. fastidiosa gave positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eight months postinoculation, another six plants inoculated with CVC-X. fastidiosa gave positive PCR results. The two X. fastidiosa strains were isolated from the inoculated plants and showed the same characteristics as the original clones by microscopy, ELISA, and PCR. None of the plants inoculated with sterile periwinkle wilt (PW) medium as controls gave positive reactions in diagnostic tests, and none developed disease symptoms. Six months postinoculation, seven plants inoculated with CLS-X. fastidiosn and eight inoculated with CVC-X. fastidiosa began to develop characteristic CLS symptoms, including apical and marginal leaf scorch, defoliation, and reductions of internode length, leaf size, and plant height, terminal clusters of small chlorotic and deformed leaves, and lateral shoot dieback. We have demonstrated that X, fastidiosa from citrus plants is pathogenic for coffee plants. This has important consequences for the management of CLS disease and has implications for the origin of citrus variegated chlorosis disease."

In 1996 it was determined that Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of bacterial leaf scorch in numerous other tree species, was playing a major role in the development of sycamore dieback. Beginning in 1998, a number of greenhouse and field experiments were initiated to learn more about disease development caused by X. fastidiosa in plantation-grown sycamore. Symptoms are being evaluated in the crowns of three and four-year-old sycamores from 26 families that were exposed to naturally occurring bacterial leaf scorch infections. Bacterial leaf scorch symptoms were evident within five months of challenging one-year-old seedlings of fifteen other sycamore families with X. fastidiosa. Populations of xylem-feeding insects that may transport X. fastidiosa from host to host are being documented. The future use of American sycamore as a major source of fiber for forest industries may depend on the success of a breeding program designed to mitigate the effects of bacterial leaf scorch."

Plant Dis. 96:1488-1494. Management of almond leaf scorch disease requires knowledge of all possible infection pathways. The disease is caused by the xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which is transmitted by several species of sharpshooters. The objectives of this research were to elucidate the fate of bacteria in planta after inoculations in almond nursery plants and to determine patterns of insect vector population dynamics and temporal distribution of X. fastidiosa infected plants relative to host plant assemblages in habitats surrounding commercial nurseries. In an experimental nursery, disease incidence was markedly affected by rootstock type. Prior to bud grafting, 'Nemaguard' rootstock seedlings were not susceptible to bacterial infection. After bud grafting with a susceptible scion ('Sonora'), scions were susceptible to infection regardless of rootstock genotype. Surveys near commercial nurseries revealed that only habitats with permanent grass cover sustained vector populations throughout the season. A total of 87 plant samples tested positive for X. fastidiosa (6.3%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a higher number of X. fastidiosa infected plants found in weedy alfalfa fields than in other habitat types. Among plant species infected by X. fastidiosa, 33% were winter annuals, 45% were biennials or perennials, and 22% were summer annuals. Collectively, these findings identified a potential pathway for X. fastidiosa infection of almonds in nursery situations."

Symptoms appeared on leaves in early July and stayed until the leaves dropped in winter. If unchecked, dieback of twigs and branches, and finally death of the infected trees occurred within a few years. The disease was closely associated with a xylem-limited bacterium. An electron micrograph showed that the bacterium was rod-shaped with rippled cell walls, and measured from 0.2 to 0.5 X 1.1 to 3.4 mum. The bacterium could be cultured on PD2 and PW media but not on general-purpose bacterial media. Colonies were convex, roundish, and creamy white with a smooth margin, and reached 0.1-0.2 mm in diameter after a 14-day incubation at 30 C. Serologically, our culture was not closely related to the Xylella fastidiosa MT1 strain originally isolated from tissues with alfalfa dwarf disease. Fifty-five percent of healthy scions grafted onto water shoots of the leaf scorch-infected trees showed leaf scorch symptoms, and 50% of greenhouse-grown seedlings artificially inoculated with a bacterial strain from scorched pear developed scorch symptoms. The bacterium was reisolated from those inoculated symptomatic tissues. Control seedlings inoculated with phosphate-buffered citrate-magnesium solution remained symptomless.

Multiple viticultural parameters and Xylella fastidiosa levels were assessed for the varieties Black Spanish, Blanc du Bois, and Cynthiana in this region of intense disease pressure. Potential PD symptoms were observed uniformly in Cynthiana and sporadically in Blanc du Bois and Black Spanish postharvest. Consistent with these symptoms, Cynthiana showed significantly lower crop yield than either Blanc du Bois or Black Spanish and had significantly higher positive ELISA values for X. fastidiosa in summer petioles. Individual Cynthiana vines with higher bacterial levels as determined by ELISA exhibited correspondingly lower yields (p = 0.06). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of petiole xylem sap and PCR of petiole DNA confirmed positive X. fastidiosa ELISA readings in all three varieties. Cynthiana petioles tested by ELISA showed a dramatic increase in bacterial levels over the growing season. In contrast, bacterial levels in Black Spanish and Blanc du Bois remained lower all season despite high disease pressure. An evaluation of potential local plant reservoirs for X. fastidiosa demonstrated that at least six asymptomatic plant species tested positive by both ELISA and PCR: flex vomitoria, Vitis mustangensis, Rubus trivialis, Platanus occidentalis, Lippia nodiflora, and Lonicera japonica. In addition, June insect traps contained a significant number of X. fastidiosa-positive glassy-winged sharpshooters, Homalodisca coagulata, and several positive sharpshooters identified as Oncometopia orbona, suggesting the presence of multiple species of insect vector in this region."

From 1935 to 1941 it was in epidemic form. Since then, the annual occurrence of new cases has declined. It is irregularly distributed throughout the important grape-growing regions of the state. The symptoms are: delayed foliation of a part or of the entire vine; interveinal chlorotic mottling of the lower leaves of the shoots; dwarfing of the shoot growth of a part or of the entire vine; leaf scalding and drying of the entire leaves after midseason; wilting, withering, drying, and premature coloring of the berries on part of or on entire clusters; failure of the canes to mature evenly. The incubation period varies from 3 to 15 mos. All grapes grown in California are susceptible and show the symptoms in varying degrees. Pierce's disease is caused by a virus. The same virus also causes \alfalfa dwarf.\"" This virus can be transmitted from diseased vines to healthy vines by grafting. Insect vectors constitute the principal means of infection. The virus has been shown to be transmitted by 20 spp. of sharpshooters and spittle bugs. Only the green sharpshooter, Draecucephala minerva, and the red-headed sharpshooter, Carneocephala fulgida, are of major importance in the San Joaquin Valley. These insects breed and live on grasses. The grape and alfalfa are not normal hosts, but are occasionally fed on. The blue sharpshooter, Neo-kalla circellate, is the principal vector in the coastal counties. It infests perennial plants, including the grape. The virus has a wide host range that includes 73 spp. in 20 plant families, ranging from grasses to shrubs. Many of these plants harbor the virus but show no symptoms of the disease. Insects collected in vineyards, alfalfa fields, roadside areas, ditch banks, bogs and such natural breeding areas are frequently carriers of the virus. The removal of diseased vines at least twice each year (roguing) in vineyard plots varying in size from 5 to 120 acres did not significantly influence the occurrence of new cases of the disease. The removal of diseased vines yearly and replanting with healthy stock has maintained the stands and kept many vineyards in good production. The occurrence of the disease was not influenced by weed control, by cultivation or oil sprays, as carried out in the control plots. Neither was it influenced by practicable methods of shoot management. It was, however, closely correlated with the averages of samples of the vectors. In or following period of well over normal rainfall the incidence of the disease increased, while with below normal rainfall there was a decided drop in new cases. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. J.

Limited variability in the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was observed and, although the separation was not absolute. most strains from Costa Rica clustered with strains from the United States and not with strains from Sao Paulo. The PCR-RFLP produced different patterns of DNA bands. The same pattern was shared by strains from Costa Rica, the United States, and two coffee strains from Sao Paulo, but a different pattern was observed in six coffee and orange strains from Brazil. In all, 32 amplification products were scored in the VNTR fragment analysis. The total variation observed among the X. fastidiosa strains had significant (P < 0.001) contributions from both geography and host origin as inferred by Nei's values of genetic diversity and WINAMOVA statistics. The strains from Costa Rica were isolated from diseased grapevines, coffee, and sweet orange and these strains grouped together and could be distinguished from strains from grapevine from the United States or from either coffee or sweet orange from Sao Paulo. The strains tested from Costa Rica are most likely of local origin, although the possibility that they have been introduced along with horticultural crops cannot be excluded. In either case, they are examples of independent selection of strains of X. fastidiosa affecting coffee and sweet orange. Greater genetic similarity was observed between strains from Costa Rica and the United States than with those from Sao Paulo."

Data are presented that indicate the disease is initiated by the fastidious xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa was found consistently associated with fungal leaf scorch disease of pecan (Carya illinoinensis) in commercial orchards in Louisiana. It was generally not detected in symptomless trees. The disease was reproduced by inoculation of greenhouse seedlings and grafted trees with cultures of the bacterium obtained from leaves with fungal leaf scorch. The bacterium was reisolated from symptomatic tissue of inoculated pecan seedlings, but not from symptomless plants inoculated with water to complete Koch's postulates. It is proposed that the name of the disease be changed to pecan bacterial leaf scorch because fungi do not appear to be necessary for symptom development."

For the first time, the bacterium was isolated from infected olive on culture media. Genetic information were obtained through genomic comparison with other subspecies or strains. The sequences of thirteen genes from its genome, comprising seven housekeeping genes (leuA, petC, lacF, cysG, holC, nuoL and gltT) usually used in multilocus sequence typing (MLST) systems, and six genes involved in different biochemical functions (RNA Pol sigma-70 factor, hypothetical protein HL, 16S rRNA, rfbD, nuoN, and pilU), were analyzed. The sequences of the biochemical function genes were explored individually to study the genetic structure of this bacterium, while the MLST genes were linked together into one concatameric sequence (4161 bp long) to increase the resolution of the phylogenetic analysis when compared with Xf strains previously reported. Sequence analyses of single genes showed that the Xf olive strain is distinct from the four previously defined taxons (Xf subsp. fastidiosa, Xf subsp. multiplex, Xf subsp. sandyi and Xf subsp. pauca) with a dissimilarity rate that reached 4%. In particular, Xf from olive shared the greatest identity with the strain \""9a5c\"" (subsp. pauca), but was nevertheless distinct from it. Similarly, the MLST based on concatameric sequences confirmed the genetic variance of Xf from olive by generating a novel sequence type profile (ST53). Phylogenetic tree analyses showed that Xf from olive clustered in one clade close to subspecies pauca (strains \""9a5c\"" and \""CVC0018\""), but was nevertheless distinct from them.

This bacterium colonizes plant xylem, thereby interrupting sap flow. Other disease symptoms depend on environmental factors, since asymptomatic and symptomatic CVC plants may be genetically similar. The endophytic microbiome comprises many microbial species that may interact with pathogens, reducing disease symptoms and improving plant growth. However, the genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie this interaction are largely unknown. In this study, the citrus endophytic bacterium Methylobacterium mesophilicum SR1.6/6 was isolated from healthy plants. This bacterium was able to colonize citrus xylem and could be transferred from plant to plant by Bucephalogonia xanthopis (Insecta), suggesting that this endophytic bacterium may interact with X. fastidiosa in planta, as a result of co-transmission by the same insect vector. To better understand how X. fastidiosa genetic responds to the presence of M. mesophilicum in the same environment, we used microarrays to evaluate the transcriptional profile of X. fastidiosa, after in vitro co-cultivation with M. mesophilicum SR1.6/6. The results showed that during co-cultivation with M. mesophilicum, X. fastidiosa downregulated genes related to growth, while genes related to energy production (cellular respiration) and transport were upregulated. Moreover, X. fastidiosa modulates genes associated with molecular recognition, nutrient competition and the stress response, suggesting the existence of a specific adaptive response to the presence of M. mesophilicum in the culture medium"

Fresh cross-sections of young twigs and leaf petioles were printed onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed in the laboratory. Analyses of a first group of 61 samples gave similar efficiency for the three diagnostic techniques for detection the bacterium (24 positive and 36 negative samples), except for a single sample which was positive only with DTBIA and PCR. Similar results were obtained by separately analyzing suckers and twigs collected from different sectors of tree canopies of a second group of 20 olive trees (ten symptomatic and ten symptomless). In this second test the three diagnostic techniques confirmed the irregular distribution of the bacterium in the tree canopies and erratic detectability of the pathogen in the young suckers. It is therefore necessary to analyse composite samples per tree which should be prepared with twigs collected from different sides of the canopy. The efficiency comparable to ELISA and PCR, combined with the advantages of easier handling, speed and cost, make DTBIA a valid alternative to ELISA in large-scale surveys for occurrence of X. fastidiosa. Moreover, the printing of membranes directly in the field prevents infections spreading to Xylella-free areas, through movement of plant material with pathogen vectors for laboratory testing."

Among systemic pathogens of citrus, Xylella fastidiosa the causal agent of the citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), is one the most important pathogens causing decline in tree vigour and productivity. Seven-year experiments were conducted to evaluate the hypothesis of seed-to-seedling transmission of X. fastidiosa. This bacterium was found colonizing the fruit (exocarp, central axis and mesocarp) and the seed parts (seed coat and endosperm plus embryo). After 7 years of PCR assay, no positive PCR detection of X. fastidiosa was confirmed in seedlings propagated from the seeds infected with X. fastidiosa. This result demonstrates the lack of seed-to-seedling transmission of this bacterium."

By using the electrical penetration graph technique, we compared the numbers and durations of stylet penetration activities by adults of the sharpshooter vector Bucephalogonia xanthophis (Berg) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) on healthy and X. fastidiosa-infected sweet orange seedlings (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, cv. Pera). Infected plants were either symptomatic, exhibiting the typical CVC, symptoms or totally asymptomatic. The mean time needed to contact xylem and start xylem sap ingestion after the onset of the first probe was similar among treatments. However, the average time elapsed between the onset of the first probe and the beginning of sustained xylem ingestion (>5 min) was longer on plants with CVC symptoms than on infected asymptomatic or healthy plants. In addition, the length of time spent in ingestion activities was much shorter on symptomatic plants. Our results showed that CVC symptomatic citrus plants were a less acceptable host than uninfected or asymptomatic X. fastidiosa-infected plants. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that symptomless infected citrus treesmaybe more important as sources for CVC spread than severely diseased ones."

Cobine"	The Bacterial Pathogen Xylella fastidiosa Affects the Leaf Ionome of Plant Hosts during Infection	"The Bacterial Pathogen Xylella fastidiosa Affects the Leaf Ionome of Plant Hosts during Infection | Xylella fastidiosa is a plant pathogenic bacterium that lives inside the host xylem vessels, where it forms biofilm believed to be responsible for disrupting the passage of water and nutrients. Here, Nicotiana tabacum was infected with X. fastidiosa, and the spatial and temporal changes in the whole-leaf ionome (i.e. the mineral and trace element composition) were measured as the host plant transitioned from healthy to diseased physiological status. The elemental composition of leaves was used as an indicator of the physiological changes in the host at a specific time and relative position during plant development. Bacterial infection was found to cause significant increases in concentrations of calcium prior to the appearance of symptoms and decreases in concentrations of phosphorous after symptoms appeared. Field-collected leaves from multiple varieties of grape, blueberry, and pecan plants grown in different locations over a four-year period in the Southeastern US showed the same alterations in Ca and P. This descriptive ionomics approach characterizes the existence of a mineral element-based response to X. fastidiosa using a model system suitable for further manipulation to uncover additional details of the role of mineral elements during plant-pathogen interactions. This is the first report on the dynamics of changes in the ionome of the host plant throughout the process of infection by a pathogen."

"Is Vector Control Sufficient to Limit Pathogen Spread in Vineyards? | Vector control is widely viewed as an integral part of disease management. Yet epidemiological theory suggests that the effectiveness of control programs at limiting pathogen spread depends on a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of a pathosystem. Moreover, control programs rarely evaluate whether reductions in vector density or activity translate into reduced disease prevalence. In areas of California invaded by the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis Germar), Pierce's disease management relies heavily on chemical control of this vector, primarily via systemic conventional insecticides (i.e., imidacloprid). But, data are lacking that attribute reduced vector pressure and pathogen spread to sharpshooter control. We surveyed 34 vineyards over successive years to assess the epidemiological value of within-vineyard chemical control. The results showed that imidacloprid reduced vector pressure without clear nontarget effects or secondary pest outbreaks. Effects on disease prevalence were more nuanced. Treatment history over the preceding 5 yr affected disease prevalence, with significantly more diseased vines in untreated compared with regularly or intermittently treated vineyards. Yet, the change in disease prevalence between years was low, with no significant effects of insecticide treatment or vector abundance. Collectively, the results suggest that within-vineyard applications of imidacloprid can reduce pathogen spread, but with benefits that may take multiple seasons to become apparent. The relatively modest effect of vector control on disease prevalence in this system may be attributable in part to the currently low regional sharpshooter population densities stemming from area-wide control, without which the need for within-vineyard vector control would be more pronounced."

There are presently no effective control methods to prevent or treat PD. The therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of a phage cocktail composed of four virulent (lytic) phages was evaluated for control of PD. Xf levels in grapevines were significantly reduced in therapeutically or prophylactically treated grapevines. PD symptoms ceased to progress one week post-therapeutic treatment and symptoms were not observed in prophylactically treated grapevines. Cocktail phage levels increased in grapevines in the presence of the host. No in planta phage-resistant Xfisolates were obtained. Moreover, Xf mutants selected for phage resistance in vitro did not cause PD symptoms. Our results indicate that phages have great potential for biocontrol of PD and other economically important diseases caused by Xylella."

X. fastidiosa is thought to induce disease by colonizing and clogging xylem vessels through the formation of cell aggregates and bacterial biofilms. Here we examine the role in X. fastidiosa virulence of an uncharacterized gene, PD1671, annotated as a two-component response regulator with potential GGDEF and EAL domains. GGDEF domains are found in c-di-GMP diguanylate cyclases while EAL domains are found in phosphodiesterases, and these domains are for c-di-GMP production and turnover, respectively. Functional analysis of the PD1671 gene revealed that it affected multiple X. fastidiosa virulence-related phenotypes. A Tn5 PD1671 mutant had a hypervirulent phenotype in grapevines presumably due to enhanced expression of gum genes leading to increased exopolysaccharide levels that resulted in elevated biofilm formation. Interestingly, the PD1671 mutant also had decreased motility in vitro but did not show a reduced distribution in grapevines following inoculation. Given these responses, the putative PD1671 protein may be a negative regulator of X. fastidiosa virulence."

Sweet orange samples selected according to variety and age were collected from commercial groves in northern, central and southern regions of Sao Paulo state and analysed visually for the presence of symptoms and by PCR for the presence of X. fastidiosa. A decreasing gradient of both infected and symptomatic trees from northern to southern regions of the state was observed. However, there was a higher incidence of latent infection (symptomless trees) in the southern (32%) than in the northern and central regions (16%). The survey disclosed an increasing gradient of CVC and X. fastidiosa incidence according to the age of the trees. Infected trees younger than two years were observed only in the central region. CVC symptom expression is related to environmental conditions and the incidence of symptomatic trees does not correspond with that of trees infected by X. fastidiosa."

In addition, changes to the genetic structure of pathogen populations may affect disease epidemiology and management practices; examples include local adaptation of more fit genotypes or introduction of novel genotypes from geographically distant areas via human movement of infected plant material or insect vectors. We studied the genetic structure of Xylella fastidiosa populations causing disease in sweet orange plants in Brazil at multiple scales using fast-evolving molecular markers (simple-sequence DNA repeats). Results show that populations of X. fastidiosa were regionally isolated, and that isolation was maintained for populations analyzed a decade apart from each other. However, despite such geographic isolation, local populations present in year 2000 were largely replaced by novel genotypes in 2009 but not as a result of migration. At a smaller spatial scale (individual trees), results suggest that isolates within plants originated from a shared common ancestor. In summary, new insights on the ecology of this economically important plant pathogen were obtained by sampling populations at different spatial scales and two different time points."

To test the long-standing hypothesis that Pierce's disease results from pathogen-induced drought stress, we used the Affymetrix Vitis GeneChip to compare the transcriptional response of Vitis vinifera to Xylella infection, water deficit, or a combination of the two stresses. The results reveal a redirection of gene transcription involving 822 genes with a minimum twofold change (P < 0.05), including the upregulation of transcripts for phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, pathogenesis-related proteins, abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-responsive biosynthesis, and downregulation of transcripts related to photosynthesis, growth, and nutrition. Although the transcriptional response of plants to Xylella infection was largely distinct from the response of healthy plants to water stress, we find that 138 of the pathogen-induced genes exhibited a significantly stronger transcriptional response when plants were simultaneously exposed to infection and drought stress, suggesting a strong interaction between disease and water deficit. This interaction between drought stress and disease was mirrored in planta at the physiological level for aspects of water relations and photosynthesis and in terms of the severity of disease symptoms and the extent of pathogen colonization, providing a molecular correlate of the classical concept of the disease triangle in which environment impacts disease severity."

M., and Kirkpatrick, B. C. 2013. Almond leaf scorch disease development on almond branches high-grafted on peach rootstock. Plant Dis. 97:277-281. Development of almond leaf scorch (ALS) disease was monitored on young almond (Prunus dulcis 'NePlus' and 'Peerless') shoots produced from almond scion wood that was high-grafted on peach rootstocks (P. persica 'Queencrest/Nemaguard'), after the almond shoots were mechanically inoculated with Xylella fastidiosa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential movement of X. fastidiosa through almond peach graft unions. ALS symptoms developed on both X. fastidiosa-inoculated and uninoculated almond shoots that were high-grafted on different peach limbs of the same tree in September following inoculations with X. fastidiosa made in June and July 2002, respectively, when the average distance in peach rootstock between the two almond peach graft unions was 30.5 cm or shorter. No ALS symptoms were observed on uninoculated almond shoots late in the growing season of the second year., The incidence of ALS-affected leaves on shoots inoculated with X. fastidiosa decreased in the second year on the inoculated shoots of Peerless as determined by the number of inoculated shoots showing ALS symptoms in 2002 versus 2003. No visible ALS symptoms were observed in NePlus late in the growing season of the second year, suggesting that survival of X. fastidiosa in NePlus was less than in Peerless. These data demonstrate that movement of X. fastidiosa through two almond peach graft unions was possible during the year of inoculation when the peach rootstock stem distance between the two almond peach graft unions was minimal However, X. fastidiosa may not survive the winter season or survived so poorly as not to be able to produce ALS symptoms in the second growing season on the uninoculated shoots that previously showed ALS symptoms in the fall of the year when an adjacent shoot was inoculated. The results suggest that high-grafting almond scion wood on multiple peach rootstock limbs may provide a means to limit movement of X. fastidiosa from one almond limb to another on the same tree."
