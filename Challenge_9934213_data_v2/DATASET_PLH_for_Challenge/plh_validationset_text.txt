Oosterlaken"	"Robinia pseudoacacia in the Netherlands is not seriously threatened by pests and diseases"	"Field surveys were carried out in the Netherlands in 1998 to investigate the occurrence of pests and plant diseases of 2000 R. pseudoacacia. The most common fungal diseases were Fusarium lateritium [Gibberella baccata], Septoria robiniae and mildew, while Aphis fabae, Cercopis sanguinea, and Lepidoptera larvae were the most common insect pests. However, none of the insect pests and plant diseases caused severe damage. Potential threats from other countries include Verticillium dahliae, Megacyllene robiniae, Parectopa robiniella, Phyllonorycter robiniellus and Odontota dorsalis."

Originally distributed in North America, the species has been spreading steadily in Europe since 2007. The found animal showed a conspicuous behaviour in which the wings were held over the body. A further spread of C. annulipes in Europe can be expected."

Marjanovic"	"Obolodiplosis robiniae (Haldeman) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) - a new invasive insect pest on black locust in Serbia"	"Invasive insect O. robiniae is a new pest highly hazardous to black locust in forest ecosystems, urban green spaces, in nurseries of forest planting material and in nurseries of ornamental planting material. Locust gall midge in Serbia develops three to four generations a year. It hibernates in the larval stage in the litter, and the adults emerge in April. The first generation develops during April and May, and the first adults were observed in west Serbia at the end of May. The development of the second generation occurs in June and at the beginning of July, and the third generation ranges from July to August. The fourth generation develops from September to the end of October. The pupal stage in the first and the second generations terminates in the gall. The larvae of the third generation leave the galls and hibernate in the ground and chrysalide in the following spring. The parasitoid of locust gall midge Platygaster robiniae Buhl & Duso (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) was found in the area of Belgrade and in west Serbia. The parasitoid also originates from North America. The economic and ecological impacts of gall midge range from the assessments that they are insignificant (Switzerland), to emphasising the hazard to ornamental plant nursery production (Check Republic), and to the classification as dangerous pests of black locust (China). In South Chorea and Ukraine, gall midge was designated as a dangerous risk factor for apicultural production. Black locust is a valuable melliferous species in our country and the impact of this invasive insect on apicultural production should be investigated. The method of O. robiniae introduction and its spreading in Serbia are not known for the time being. One of the potential ways is by plating material. The first symptoms of infestation were observed on the seedlings originating from the nursery in the surroundings of Krusevac. As our producers purchase the reproductive material from the nurseries in Italy, Slovenia and Hungary, it is highly possible that O. robiniae was accidentally introduced with the planting material. Another possibility of invasion is accidental, by transport vehicles or by wind from the Republic of Srpska and Croatia. The method of introduction and the spreading of the parasitoid P. robiniae is probably the same as that of its host. In the last several years the import of reproductive material of ornamental plants has been increasing and also the risk on introducing the invasive organisms. The study of black locust entomofauna should be continued."

Isolation and inoculation experiments indicate that Phytophthora cinnamomi is the pathogen. Infection occurs from March to Oct. (mostly May-Sept.). The pathogen attacks the trunk or roots to induce necrosis of the inner bark usually around the basal or lower trunk. Saprophytic sporodochia may be observed in cracks or diseased parts of the bark. When the trunk is completely encircled, the tree wilts gradually."

REID"	"Inonotus rickii (Pat.) Reid is a pathogenic wood-decaying fungus that causes severe decay in several ornamental urban trees in Europe. It has been known to occur on different hosts in Sicily (Italy) since 1985, and in Rome (Italy) since 2003. Some physical and mechanical wood features were studied according to the standards in order to propose an investigation methodology to set a deterioration ranking of urban trees. In this phase of the study, Celtis australis L., Acer negundo L., Acer campestre L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Tilia x vulgaris Hayne, Ulmus minor Mill., Platanus x acerifolia (Aiton) Willd. and Quercus ilex L. were studied. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and M-ANOVA tests to check the differences among the specimens. A risk matrix was created in order to combine the features that showed statistical differences between the control specimens and the inoculated specimens, in order to establish, in vitro, a degradation ranking among the wood species. The wood species which showed no in vitro durability to I. rickii, were the same ones that displayed susceptibility in the living trees."

Resulting butterflies were freeze-dried, extracted with methanol, and quantitatively analysed by HPLC for their flavonoid patterns and content. Female butterflies typically sequestered more flavonoids than males, but the magnitude of this difference (0-60 %) varied with food plant. Butterflies reared on natural food sources contained more flavonoids than those raised on food media which are accepted only in experiments. Furthermore, flavonoid content was strongly correlated with adult dry weight. The results demonstrate that the highly variable quantitative and qualitative patterns of flavonoid accumulation in the butterfly P. icarus are governed by a combination of factors such as food plant species or organ, sex, and adult size."

The ribosomal DNA ITS sequences exhibit high homology with the ITS sequences of Phialocephala fortinii and with those of various ericoid mycorrhizal fungi placed in the Helotiales, and Mollisia species. The fungus is found consistently on the undersides of decorticated logs, branches, and stumps of Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust) in contact with the soil in the eastern United States. Cadophora hiberna is unusual because of its membranous, sporodochial conidiomata that form only on decorticated wood of R. pseudoacacia, and develop early in the winter and persist until spring. Cadophora hiberna was isolated from soil in the proximity of R. pseudoacacia and once from river silt."

Esaki"	"Management of Apriona japonica Thomson (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults by spraying feeding trees with fenitrothion"	"The longhorn beetle, Apriona japonica, damages various broad-leaved trees. In a mixed forest of Robinia pseudoacacia and Celtis sinensis at Uchinada, Ishikawa Prefecture, bark-feeding adults are thought to attack C. sinensis primarily and to deposit eggs mainly on R. pseudoacacia. In order to verify the utility of fenitrothion-spraying to control A. japonica adults, I sprayed the branches of C. sinensis trees with 4.4% fenitrothion twice in the field, just before the occurrence of A. japonica adults and three weeks later. A. japonica adults were killed continuously throughout the period that they occurred on C. sinensis trees. I reared A. japonica adults in the laboratory on C. sinensis branches that were sprayed with 0.44% fenitrothion once and/or twice at a three-week interval. All adults were killed within three days when they fed on the branches sprayed once 1-4 weeks and those sprayed twice 4-6 weeks before the experiments, respectively. These results suggest that spraying fenitrothion should be effective in the management of A. japonica adults and that spraying of 0.44% fenitrothion twice at a 3 week interval can kill nearly 100% of adults over a period of nine weeks."

In the second half of August 1975, it was observed infesting soy bean on one farm in the Crimea, and in the same year it occurred on watermelon at several places in the Ukraine. It had evidently migrated to these crops from shelter belts of R. pseudacacia and other food-plants (on which infestation was 17-100%). Eggs were numerous on soy bean and watermelon, and more so than on the wild food-plants mentioned. Populations on the two crops varied indirectly with the distance from the shelter belts and directly with the degree of infestation of the trees. No infestation was observed at distances greater than 300 m, while at distances of 50-60 and 3-15 m there were 1-2 and 3-4 or more individuals per watermelon plant. Both early and late varieties of watermelon were attacked. On soy bean, the insects occurred mainly on the lower parts of the stems, and infestation reached 9-17 at 12 m from the trees with 45-62% of the crop affected, 5-9 at 13-30 m with 26-40% infestation, 3-4 with 20% infestation at 32-50 m and 1-2 with 7-8% at 100 m. All varieties of soy bean (both indigenous and introduced) seemed susceptible to infestation, but there were some differences between them. For prevention of attack, isolation from sources of infestation is essential, and forest belts can be sprayed with DNOC in early spring if the insect becomes numerous on R. pseudacacia."

H., L:D 14:10 H. and mentioned constant temperatures) during 2000-2001 in Kerman, Iran. The objective of this investigation was to identify growth rate of aphid population in various temperatures and host plants. The results indicated that net reproduction rate (R0) of aphid in 16 +- 2degreeC on alfalfa and locust tree was 40/2992 and 34/16242 respectively. Gross reproductive rate (GRR) was also 66/3965 and 72/0972 respectively. In 20 +- 2degreeC, R0 and GRR on alfalfa were 93/2996 and 100/51 and on locust tree 76/514 and 83/34 respectively. In 30 +- 2degreeC these factors were 34/9053 and 50/9877 on alfalfa and 4/4298 and 5/43 on locust tree respectively. The stable population parameters of alfalfa black aphid include intrinsic rate of natural increases (rm), finite rate of increases (lambda), intrinsic birth rate (b), intrinsic death rate (d), doubling time (DT), mean generation time (T) and rate of weekly multiplication (rw) which were calculated in mentioned temperatures and host plants. The (rm) and (T) in 16, 20 and 30degreeC were 0/1859, 19/8834; 0/2865, 15/832 and 0/4462, 7/962 on alfalfa and were 0/1930, 18/2960; 0/2902, 14/946 and 0/1596, 9/3255 on locust tree respectively.

In the Sumi region of the Soviet Union ten species are present (referred to here by the popular Russian names only) and two [S. lineatus (L.) and S. crinitus (Hbst.)] are particularly injurious. According to data in the literature, the overwintered weevils feed at first on perennial legumes and then migrate to annual or first-year perennial crops. After the harvest of annual crops, they migrate to perennials. The authors have noted that the weevils migrate not only to low-growing crops but also to leguminous trees growing in shelter belts and other sites. During 1966-73, they were seen on such trees growing close to peas and also at distances up to 1 km from them. They appeared to prefer the lower leaves, and the presence of certain tall-growing weeds favoured their movement from one tree to another. After supplementary feeding, the beetles entered hibernation in the soil beneath the crowns of the trees, returning to leguminous pasture plants in spring. The tree most frequently infested is Robinia pseudacacia."

No important insect pests of it were recorded from Europe until 1970, when trees in the Italian Provinces of Varese, Vercelli, Como and Novara were found to be heavily infested by a Lepidopterous leaf-miner since identified as Parectopa robiniella (Clem.), which is known to damage the tree in the United States [cf. RAE/A 26, p. 549; 54, p. 116]. The adult is described and, from observations in the field and laboratory in 1970, information is given on its bionomics. P. robiniella overwintered as a full-fed larva in a cocoon among dead leaves on the soil, and the adults appeared in April-May and oviposited in May or June on the lower surface of the leaves. The larva entered the leaf and by its feeding made a sinuous mine leading to a blotch mine beneath the lower surface, after which, 7-9 days after hatching, it moved to the upper surface, where it made a corresponding blotch mine with finger-like projections. Up to ten mines were observed on each leaf in the early stages, but more than one larva seldom completed its development. The whole mine complex took 20-25 days to construct. Damaged leaves fell prematurely. Larvae of the first (spring) generation left the leaves to make cocoons in the soil from June onwards. It is not yet known how many generations a year P. robiniella has in Italy. From overwintering cocoons collected in the field, an apterous Ichneumonid parasite of the genus Gelis was reared."

There were large numbers of the galls of Obolodiplosis robiniae at Dobris, Kadov near Blatna, and Pribram, and also at Ceske Budejovice some 150 km to the south of Prague. In 2006, galls of O. robiniae were discovered in the course of investigations at 3 localities in Calabria, southern Italy (Bonifati Marina, Cetraro, Cittadella del Capo) and in South Tyrol in northern Italy (Kastelruth, Klobenstein, St. Konstantin, and St. Zyprian). In 2007, galls were found at 2 localities in South Tyrol (Bruneck and Muhlbach), but galls were not discovered in the Olympos Region of Greece. The present known first occurrences of O. robiniae in various parts of Europe, starting with its first appearance in 2003 in Italy. The galls were subsequently found in the following localities in Italy: in Lombardia in the Provincia Como, Bergamo; in Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Lombardia, and Emilia Romagna. In Germany, galls have been found at Baden, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Sandhausen, Kraichgau, Bruchsal, Karlsruhe, Eschbach (Pfalz), and Hirschhorn (Odenwald). One of the probable reasons for the rapid spread of O. robiniae in Europe may be that forest nurseries and nurseries raising ornamental shrubs and trees sell small seedlings of Robinia pseudoacacia on which the attack by gall midges is not distinct because only eggs or very small first instar larvae are present in the bursting leaflets and are practically invisible to the naked eye. Another reason for the rapid spread may be the substantial international traffic along the streets and roads. Larvae drop from the galls and may be transported over large distances on the wheels and other parts of vehicles. The rate of spread also depends on the density of suitable host plants. High fecundity of females and exponential growth of populations in the course of one vegetative season have also contributed to the rapid spread of this species in Europe."

Affected leaves drop, shoot growth is stunted, and apical leaves are small and chlorotic. Symptoms may progress to shoot dieback. Only scorched leaves which could not be related to other known agents consistently contained bacteria and bacterial agglomerates when observed with light microscopy. Only plants with these symptoms were positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests using antiserum to Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al. The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al. was isolated in November 1995 from coffee (Coffea arabica) leaves with scorch symptoms on supplemented periwinkle wilt medium. Colonies were circular, dome-shaped, white, and 0.5 to 1.5 mm in diameter. Two of 10 young coffee seedlings stem-inoculated with a suspension of the isolated X. fastidiosa in January 1996 showed leaf scorch symptoms 3 to 5 months later, contained bacteria in xylem extracts, and reacted positively in ELISA using antiserum to the citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) strain of X. fastidiosa. ELISA-positive bacteria were reisolated from this plant. None of the symptomless plants, including controls, revealed bacteria on microscopic examinations, ELISA, or isolation attempts. Antisera developed against cultured bacteria from both CLS and CVC plants reacted positively against plant extracts of both diseases in dot immunobinding assays (DIBA). The level of detection was about 5 x 10(5) bacteria ml(-1) for both homologous and heterologous reactions. The polymerase chain reaction amplification products produced by CLS and CVC strains of X. fastidiosa were indistinguishable. Geographical distribution of these strains is not the same. CLS is widespread and usually occurs if coffee is adjacent to CVC-affected citrus. However, CVC does not always occur when citrus is grown adjacent to CLS-affected coffee. The bacteria are closely related, if not identical."

Purified DNA was amplified under nonstringent conditions with single primers 21 nucleotides (nt) long. Thirty-nine amplification products were observed that were useful to distinguish among the strains and to derive a similarity matrix and construct a phenogram showing possible relationships among the strains. Strains isolated from diseased coffee and citrus in Brazil were closely related to each other (coefficient of similarity of 0.872), but only distantly related to a strain isolated from diseased grapevine in the USA (coefficient of similarity of 0.650). Strains of Xylella fastidiosa isolated from diseased plums in the USA and Brazil clustered with strains from different hosts isolated from their respective countries of origin. Thus, there may be two quite dissimilar clusters of strains of Xylella fastidiosa, one in North America and the other in South America. Each cluster contains strains that can cause disease in plum. The methods described provide a convenient and rapid method to distinguish between strains of Xylella fastidiosa that cause diseases of coffee and citrus in the same region of Brazil. This has not been possible previously. This will potentially enable the two strains to be distinguished in alternate hosts or in insect vectors."

A variety of plant species found near a severe outbreak of PD in vineyards in the Temecula Valley of California were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, culture on media, and polymerase chain reaction to identify potential inoculum sources in the area. Species that consistently tested positive for X. fastidiosa were the known hosts, grape, almond, and oleander, and two new hosts, Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) and wild mustard (Brassica spp). Sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer region found that strains isolated from grapevine, Spanish broom, wild mustard, and almond clustered with previously sequenced PD strains. Thus, these species could serve as sources of inoculum for infection of grapevines and should be removed or monitored for signs of infection. Sequences from oleander isolates from Temecula formed another cluster with a previously published oleander strain sequence. Oleander strains do not infect grapevines and thus do not appear to cause a direct threat to grapevines. Two additional isolates from almond were determined to be genetically different from PD strains, and the ability of these strains to infect grapevine is not known. Greenhouse transmission studies indicate that the glassy-winged sharpshooter was able to transmit a PD strain of X. fastidiosa to Spanish broom, black mustard, and other hosts."

Plant Dis. 96:1123-1134. Xylella fastidiosa causes disease in a number of economically important crops, ornamental plants, and shade trees, including grapevine, citrus, oleander, and sycamore. In pecan, X. fastidiosa causes pecan bacterial leaf scorch (PBLS), which leads to defoliation and reduces nut yield. No economically effective treatments are available for PBLS. In order to improve PBLS management practices, it is necessary to determine the subspecies of X. fastidiosa strains that infect pecan so that potential sources of inoculum may be identified. Multiprimer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequence data from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and pglA consistently identified strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from pecan as X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR analyses were congruent with phylogenetic analyses.

The exact mechanism of hydraulic disruption and systemic colonization of xylem byXf remains elusive across all host plants. To understand both processes better, the functional and structural characteristics of xylem in different organs of both healthy andXf-infected trees of severalQuercus species were studied. Hydraulic conductivity (K(s)) inXf-infected petioles ofQ. palustris andQ. rubra decreased significantly compared with healthy trees as the season progressed and plummeted to zero with the onset of scorch symptoms. Prior to the onset of symptoms, embolism was as much as 3.7 times higher inXf-infected petioles compared with healthy controls and preceded significant reductions inK(s). Embolism likely resulted from pit membrane degradation during colonization of new petiole xylem and triggered the process that eventually led to vessel occlusion. Pit membrane porosity was studied using the following four methods to determine if a pathway exists in the xylem network of woody stems that allows for passiveXf migration: (i) calculations based on vulnerability to cavitation data, (ii) scanning electron micrographs, (iii) microsphere injections, and (iv) air seeding thresholds on individual vessels. All four methods consistently demonstrated that large pit membrane pores (i.e. greater than the diameter of individualXf) occur frequently throughout the secondary stem xylem in severalQuercus species. These large pores probably facilitate systemic colonization of the secondary xylem network and contribute to the high susceptibility to bacterial leaf scorch exhibited among these species."

The aggregative nature of this bacterium has been extensively documented in the plant xylem and the insect's foregut. Structured communities of microbial aggregates enclosed in a self-produced polymeric matrix and attached to a surface are defined as biofilms. In this study, we characterized biofilm formation by X. fastidiosa through the use of a novel in vitro assay for studying biofilm growth in a potential mimic system of what might occur in planta. We used wood, a xylem rich material, as a surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation, under shear force. We demonstrated that X. fastidiosa strains isolated from various hosts formed biofilm on wood in this in vitro assay. Different biofilm morphology was detected, which seems to vary according to the strain tested and microenvironmental conditions analyzed. We observed that strains from different hosts could be grouped according to three parameters: biofilm morphology, the ability to form clumps in liquid culture, and the ability to attach to glass surfaces. We hypothesize that biofilm formation is likely a major virulence factor in diseases related to X. fastidiosa, bringing a new perspective for disease treatment."

The disease has recently received national and international concerns due to its outbreak in California. Pierce's disease is caused by a bacterial pathogen known as Xylella fastidiosa (XF) which is transmitted by leaf hoppers when they feed on grapevines. It has generally been believed that clogging the xylem vessels by XF results in the typical PD symptoms: marginal necrosis, uneven lignifications of annual canes, abscissions occurring between leaf blades and petioles, and dead shoots. However, there are many unexplained phenomenon during the course of the disease development, and the real causes of PD maybe more complicated than water deficiency. In order to better understand the mechanism of the disease development and host plant resistance to PD infection, we have been investigating the pathogenesis of XF, interactions between XF and grapevine, variations and changes of plant growth regulators among PD resistant and susceptible grapes. It appeared that the PD symptom development associated with physiological and biochemical changes of grapevines. For example, both ABA and SA levels increased during the course of PD development. In the mean time, PD infected leaves showed various abnormalities with symptoms similar to mineral nutrient imbalances such as phosphorous (P) deficiency and magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) toxicities. In addition, the PD infected leaves and petioles showed significantly lower levels of K and higher levels of Fe, Cu, and Zn than those non-infected ones. In a separate study, when culture filtrates from X. fastidiosa were placed on wounded leaf segment, the susceptible cultivars showed severe symptoms while no or very mild symptoms were found on PD resistant cultivars. Two toxic compounds were also isolated from the XF culture filtrate. This result indicated that PD symptom development maybe associated in part with a toxic effect from X. fastidiosa. Our studies revealed that the PD development involves a series of complex interactions between the XF pathogen and the host plant, and many physiological and biochemical changes occured in the host plants during PD development."

X. fastidiosa has also been obtained from other host plants, in direct correlation with the development of diseases, as in the case of coffee leaf scorch (CLS) a disease with potential to cause severe economic losses to the Brazilian coffee industry. This paper describes a thorough genomic characterization of coffee-infecting X fastidiosa strains, initially performed through a microarray-based approach, which demonstrated that CLS strains could be subdivided in two phylogenetically distinct subgroups. Whole-genomic sequencing of two of these bacteria (one from each subgroup) allowed identification of ORFs and horizontally transferred elements (HTEs) that were specific to CLS-related X fastidiosa strains. Such analyses confirmed the size and importance of HTEs as major mediators of chromosomal evolution amongst these bacteria, and allowed identification of differences in gene content, after comparisons were made with previously sequenced X. fastidiosa strains, isolated from alternative hosts. Although direct experimentation still needs to be performed to elucidate the biological consequences associated with such differences, it was interesting to verify that CLS-related bacteria display variations in genes that produce toxins, as well as surface-related factors (such as fimbrial adhesins and LPS) that have been shown to be involved with recognition of specific host factors in different pathogenic bacteria"

Based on the presence, absence, or difference in intensity of 10 protein bands within the 21.5 to 45.0 kDa molecular mass range, the strains could be subdivided into four distinct pathogenic groups and two miscellaneous groups whose members were pathogenic to various different hosts. Group I was the Pierce's disease of grapevine pathogenic group. Although 4 of these 45 strains had hosts of origin other than grapevine, they all produced Pierce's disease symptoms. Uniform, distinct protein profiles also occur-red with group 2 (elderberry leaf scorch strains), group 3 (oak leaf scorch strains), and group 4 (oleander leaf scorch strains). Groups 5 and 6 were made up of strains pathogenic to almond, blackberry, lupine, mulberry, periwinkle, elm, and plum. Thus, whole-cell protein analysis was shown to be a rapid and consistent method for identifying four pathogenic groups of X. fastidiosa strains."

The Kosova isolate was a rod-shaped bacterium which showed a typically rippled cell wall under electron microscopy. ELISA comparisons indicated that the Kosova isolate was closely related to the U.S. PD strains and to several other strains of X. fastidiosa. When DNA extracted from diseased grapevines collected from Kosova was used as template in PCR with primer sets specific for X. fastidiosa, a band of about 730 bp diagnostic for PD bacteria was detected. DNA from the isolated Kosova bacteria and the type strain of PD yielded the same length of DNA fragment in PCR assay. The Kosova isolate was inoculated into young healthy grapevines through the roots with negative pressure applied to the shoots. Typical scald and scorch symptoms appeared on the leaves of the inoculated grapevines 40-80 days after inoculation. The same bacteria were reisolated from these inoculated diseased plants and used to reinoculate young grapevines. The reinoculated grapevines produced the same symptoms, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates. This is the first confirmation that PD of grapes occurs in Europe."

This disease has become serious in the Washington, D. C. area during the past decade. It also appears to be widespread in the southeastern states. The results of these transmission tests show that elm scorch symptoms are transmissible by chip bud and scion inoculum, but not by bark patches. Transmission reported from chip bud and scion inoculum is considered significant and indicates a virus to be the cause of this disease. Moreover, as transmission resulted only from inoculum containing xylem tissue as in chip buds and scions, and not from strictly phloem inoculum as in bark patches, it seems reasonable to conclude that the virus develops in the xylem and not in the phloem. The foliar symptoms of elm scorch are somewhat similar to Pierce s disease of grape which is also caused by a virus (Morsus suffodiens Holmes) that develops in the xylem. This virus may prove to be the cause of elm scorch of American elm. ABSTRACT AUTHORS: G. K. Parris"

While the rpfF mutant was very poorly transmitted by vectors irrespective of whether they had also fed on plants infected with the wild-type strain, wild-type strains were not efficiently transmitted if vectors had fed on plants infected with the rpfF mutant. About 100-fewer cells of a wild-type strain attached to wings of a vector when suspended in xylem sap from plants infected with an rpfF mutant than in sap from uninfected grapes. The frequency of transmission of cells suspended in sap from plants that were infected by the rpfF mutant was also reduced over threefold. Wild-type cells suspended in a culture supernatant of an rpfF mutant also exhibited 10-fold less adherence to wings than when suspended in uninoculated culture media. A factor released into the xylem by rpfF mutants, and to a lesser extent by the wild-type strain, thus inhibits their attachment to, and thus transmission by, sharpshooter vectors and may also enable them to move more readily through host plants."

Strains of X. fastidiosa isolated from ornamentals were characterized using a multiprimer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. and sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR). Based on RAPD-PCR and 16S-23S rDNA ISR, strains isolated from daylily. jacaranda, and magnolia clustered with members of X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi and caused oleander leaf scorch but not Pierce's disease symptoms in glasshouse assays on oleander and grape, respectively. This demonstrated both that our groupings based on genetic characterization were valid and that strains of X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi are present in hosts other than oleander. Strains isolated from Spanish broom, cherry, and one strain isolated from western redbud clustered with X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa members. Strains isolated from purple-leafed plum, olive, peach, plum, sweetgum, maidenhair tree, crape myrtle, and another western redbud strain clustered with members of X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex.

Infections occlude the xylem of affected plants, causing drought-like symptoms and, eventually, plant death. To assess the likelihood of mitigation of bacterial leaf scorch through cultural practices such as pruning or hedging of affected plants, we determined the localization and population density of X. fastidiosa in naturally infected blueberry plants with varying levels of bacterial leaf scorch severity. Stem segments were sampled from the current season's growth down to the base of the plant, as were root segments on plants that were either asymptomatic or had light, moderate, or severe symptoms in three plantings affected by the disease. Stem sap was extracted from each segment and population densities of X. fastidiosa were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction with species-specific primers. Detection frequencies were lowest (but non-zero) in sap from asymptomatic plants and highest in plants with severe symptoms. In asymptomatic plants, detection was generally least frequent (0 to 20.0%) in top and root sections and highest (4.6 to 55.6%) in middle and base stem sections. As disease severity increased, detection frequencies in roots increased to >80% in two plantings and to 60% in the third planting. Overall, detection frequencies were highest (>80%) in middle and base stem sections of plants from the moderate and severe disease classes. The lowest bacterial titers (averaging 0 to 2.1 x 10(1) CFU per 50 mu l of sap) were observed in top and root sections of asymptomatic plants, whereas the highest titers (generally between 10(4) and 10(5) CPU per 50 mu l of sap) were obtained from middle, base, and root sections of plants from the moderate and severe classes. The presence of the bacterium in middle and base stem sections at low disease severity indicates rapid distribution of X. fastidiosa in affected plants. Because the pathogen accumulates in the roots at moderate and high disease severity levels, management strategies such as pruning and mowing are unlikely to be effective in curing affected plants from bacterial leaf scorch."

We have tested seed extracted from fruit heavily infected and symptomatic for X. fastidiosa infection as well as seed obtained from normal asymptomatic fruit from the same trees in Brazil. Seeds from symptomatic fruit were tested by PCR and found to be contaminated with X. fastidosa, and to weigh less than seeds from normal-sized fruit. Seed from both symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit were sown in the greenhouse and studied following germination. The growth of shoots, but not of roots, was reduced in seedlings produced from seed collected from symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic fruits. Symptoms of citrus variegated chlorosis were not observed in any of the seedlings derived from seed from symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit. Roots and leaf midribs from 260 seedlings were tested for the presence of X. fastidiosa by PCR three months after sowing. No positive PCR results were observed. Leaf midribs from 148 seedlings were tested subsequently at 17 months after sowing using both standard format and qPCR assays, also without any positive results. Leaf midribs from 349 seedlings from a second seed harvest were tested seven months after sowing by qPCR also without any positive tests.

Five strains of the bacteria were identified. Consistent with prior data, these strains were host specific, with only one strain associated with members of the red oak family, one strain associated with American elm, one strain associated with American sycamore, and two strains associated with mulberry. Strains found for asymptomatic foliage were the same as strains from the symptomatic foliage on individual trees. Cross transmission of the strains was not observed at sites with multiple species of infected trees within an approx. 25 m radius of one another.

PCR using the primers allowed for detection and identification of mulberry-infecting X. fastidiosa strains in cultures and in samples collected from naturally infected mulberry trees. In addition, no mixed infections with or non-specific detections of the mulberry-infecting strains of X. fastidiosa were found in naturally X. fastidiosa-infected oak, elm and sycamore trees growing in the same region where naturally infected mulberry trees were grown.

When the primer set was tested against naturally infected olive plant samples collected in Italy, it allowed for detection of olive-associated strains of X. fastidiosa in Italy.
