The objective of this investigation was to identify growth rate of aphid population in various temperatures and host plants.

Csoka","text":"The invasive spread of the gall midge Obolodiplosis robiniae in Europe | In 2005 and 2006, the level of infestation of Robinia trees in the central part of the Czech Republic was very high. There were large numbers of the galls of Obolodiplosis robiniae at Dobris, Kadov near Blatna, and Pribram, and also at Ceske Budejovice some 150 km to the south of Prague. In 2006, galls of O. robiniae were discovered in the course of investigations at 3 localities in Calabria, southern Italy (Bonifati Marina, Cetraro, Cittadella del Capo) and in South Tyrol in northern Italy (Kastelruth, Klobenstein, St. Konstantin, and St. Zyprian). In 2007, galls were found at 2 localities in South Tyrol (Bruneck and Muhlbach), but galls were not discovered in the Olympos Region of Greece. The present known first occurrences of O. robiniae in various parts of Europe, starting with its first appearance in 2003 in Italy. The galls were subsequently found in the following localities in Italy: in Lombardia in the Provincia Como, Bergamo; in Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Lombardia, and Emilia Romagna. In Germany, galls have been found at Baden, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Sandhausen, Kraichgau, Bruchsal, Karlsruhe, Eschbach (Pfalz), and Hirschhorn (Odenwald). One of the probable reasons for the rapid spread of O. robiniae in Europe may be that forest nurseries and nurseries raising ornamental shrubs and trees sell small seedlings of Robinia pseudoacacia on which the attack by gall midges is not distinct because only eggs or very small first instar larvae are present in the bursting leaflets and are practically invisible to the naked eye. Another reason for the rapid spread may be the substantial international traffic along the streets and roads. Larvae drop from the galls and may be transported over large distances on the wheels and other parts of vehicles. The rate of spread also depends on the density of suitable host plants.

There were large numbers of the galls of Obolodiplosis robiniae at Dobris, Kadov near Blatna, and Pribram, and also at Ceske Budejovice some 150 km to the south of Prague. In 2006, galls of O. robiniae were discovered in the course of investigations at 3 localities in Calabria, southern Italy (Bonifati Marina, Cetraro, Cittadella del Capo) and in South Tyrol in northern Italy (Kastelruth, Klobenstein, St. Konstantin, and St. Zyprian). In 2007, galls were found at 2 localities in South Tyrol (Bruneck and Muhlbach), but galls were not discovered in the Olympos Region of Greece. The present known first occurrences of O. robiniae in various parts of Europe, starting with its first appearance in 2003 in Italy. The galls were subsequently found in the following localities in Italy: in Lombardia in the Provincia Como, Bergamo; in Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Lombardia, and Emilia Romagna. In Germany, galls have been found at Baden, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Sandhausen, Kraichgau, Bruchsal, Karlsruhe, Eschbach (Pfalz), and Hirschhorn (Odenwald). One of the probable reasons for the rapid spread of O. robiniae in Europe may be that forest nurseries and nurseries raising ornamental shrubs and trees sell small seedlings of Robinia pseudoacacia on which the attack by gall midges is not distinct because only eggs or very small first instar larvae are present in the bursting leaflets and are practically invisible to the naked eye. Another reason for the rapid spread may be the substantial international traffic along the streets and roads. Larvae drop from the galls and may be transported over large distances on the wheels and other parts of vehicles. The rate of spread also depends on the density of suitable host plants.

Electron microscopic studies revealed that the bacterium may appear in situ evenly distributed in the lumen of the tracheary elements and, occasionally, embedded in a lucent matrix adhering to the inner surface of the cell wall elements. CVC-B measured 1-3.5-mu-m X 0.3-0.5-mu-m and appeared to be at different developmental stages; fibril-like structures were seen attached to bacteria. CVC-B rippled wall showed a periodical or annulated structural arrangement with thickness from 25-35 nm in the furrows and 45-55 nm in the ridges. The wall consisted of 3 layers, i.e., an outer, an inner (each comprised of 3-layered unit membrane structure) and a middle peptidoglycan layer. DNA-like threads and ribosome-like granules were present in the cytoplasm. CVC-B is structurally and morphologically similar to Xylella fastidiosa of which it could be a citrus strain or a strain from other hosts adapted to citrus."},"results":{"classifications":[],"annotations":[{"start":1245,"end":1251,"tag":"Plant_species"},{"start":211,"end":231,"tag":"Plant_species"},{"start":387,"end":390,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"},{"start":633,"end":636,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"},{"start":1299,"end":1305,"tag":"Plant_species"},{"start":1150,"end":1153,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"},{"start":135,"end":168,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"},{"start":1203,"end":1221,"tag":"Plant_pest"},{"start":783,"end":786,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"},{"start":60,"end":72,"tag":"Plant_species"},{"start":197,"end":209,"tag":"Plant_species"},{"start":87,"end":114,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname"}]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Title":"ISOLATION OF A XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA STRAIN INFECTING OLIVE AND OLEANDER IN APULIA, ITALY","Abstract":"The isolation in pure culture of the Xylella fastidiosa strain associated with the quick decline syndrome of olive, recently observed in Apulia (Salento peninsula, southern Italy) was attempted from symptomatic, naturally infected olive and oleander plants, and a periwinkle seedling that had been exposed to, and was infected by Xylella-positive spittlebugs.
