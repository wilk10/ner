The method would make it possible to achieve simple and rapid detection of this pathogen. Method: In present study, several sets of LAMP primers were designed using the tuf gene as the target, and then the most appropriate set was selected to develop LAMP method for detection of 16Sr I group phytoplasmas. The specificity of LAMP was tested by using 3 other groups of phytoplasma (16Sr I, 16Sr V, 16Sr XIX) which are closely related to 16Sr I group. The sensitivities between LAMP and PCR for detecting phytoplasma were compared by using two-fold serially diluted DNA extracted from phytoplasma-infected paulownia as templates. The LAMP method was used to detect the paulownia witches'-broom phytoplasmas from 6 provinces in China and 9 kinds of tissue culture seedlings. Result: The 16Sr I-LAMP was efficiently amplified with the target tuf gene sequences in 40 min at constant temperature of 63Â°C, by which five 16Sr I group phytoplasmas causing paulownia witches'-broom, chinaberry witches'-broom, mulberry dwarf, lettuce yellows and periwinkle phyllody diseases were detected, but no phytoplasmas from 16Sr I (peanut witches'-broom, sweet potato witches'-broom, cleome witches'-broom), 16Sr V (jujube witches'-broom, cherry lethal yellows, Bischofia polycarpa witches'-broom, Robinia hispida witches'-broom), and 16SrXIX (chestnut yellows crinkle) as well as healthy plant control were detected.

It was detected on several host trees in east and northeast (Khorasan), Southeast (Systan and Baluchestan), central areas (Tehran, Isfahan) and south (Kohgiloyeh and Boyer Ahmad) of Iran. host trees included Populus alba, P nigra, Juglans regia, Salix spp., Ulmus spp., Platanus orientalis, Morus alba, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Alnus subcordata, Robinia sp. and Amygdalus spp. Infestation rate was 40 to 100% on various host trees. It should be noted that, alder (Alnus subeordata) and mountain almond (Amygdalus spp.) are new host record for A. sarta in the world. Furthermore, Morus alba is reported as new host of A. sarta in Iran."},"results":{"annotations":[{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":260,"end":275},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":1125,"end":1132},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":29,"end":39},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":41,"end":57},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":277,"end":285}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Refid":666,"Author":"T.

Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are infected with a wide variety of facultative endosymbionts that can confer ecologically relevant traits, which in turn may drive microevolutionary processes in a dynamic selective environment. However, relatively little is known about how symbiont diversity is structured in most aphid species. Here, we investigate facultative symbiont species richness and prevalence among worldwide populations of the cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch. We surveyed 44 populations of A. craccivora, and detected 11 strains of facultative symbiotic bacteria, representing six genera. There were two significant associations between facultative symbiont and aphid food plant: the symbiont Arsenophonus was found at high prevalence in A. craccivora populations collected from Robinia sp. (locust), whereas the symbiont Hamiltonella was almost exclusively found in A. craccivora populations from Medicago sativa (alfalfa). Aphids collected from these two food plants also had divergent mitochondrial haplotypes, potentially indicating the formation of specialized aphid lineages associated with food plant (host-associated differentiation). The role of facultative symbionts in this process remains to be determined. Overall, observed facultative symbiont prevalence in A. craccivora was lower than that of some other well-studied aphids (e.g., Aphis fabae and Acyrthosiphon pisum), possibly as a consequence of A. craccivora's almost purely parthenogenetic life history.

Here, however, we provide evidence that host-associated herbivore lineages can intrinsically differ in their toxic properties. Lineages of Aphis craccivora originating from black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) are unsuitable food for the ladybeetle Harmonia axyridis, resulting in death of both larvae and adults, whereas aphid lineages originating from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) support larval development and adult reproduction. We show that locust-origin aphids remain toxic and alfalfa-origin aphids remain non-toxic when reared on any of three legume plants (fava, alfalfa or locust). 3. Furthermore, toxicity is not a function of the facultative bacterial symbiont Arsenophonus, which is naturally present in locust-origin aphid lineages and facilitates aphid use of locust. Experimentally cured locust-origin lineages remain toxic, and an experimentally transinfected alfalfa-origin lineage remains non-toxic to H. axyridis. 4. Instead, Arsenophonus plays an indirect role in the distribution of toxic aphid lineages by facilitating aphid use of locust. It is the parthenogenetic coinheritance of Arsenophonus and the toxic trait that observationally correlates locust-feeding with toxicity in A. craccivora, rather than host plant chemistry per se. 5.

It started its quick spread in Europe in 2003 from the Veneto region in Italy where it was first found. Platygaster robiniae (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae), parasitoid of the midge was first described as species in 2008. In the researches of the black locust gall midge only one record was given for Croatia (in 2006) but without details. The aim of this research was to record the distribution, biology, parasitoids and damages of this newly introduced insect species in Croatia. The presence of black locust gall midge was recorded by inspection of black locust leaves oil the following localities: the greater surrounding of Zagreb, Jastrebarsko, northwestern (Durmanec, Lepoglava, Ivanec), submediterranean (island Krk) and mediterranean (surrounding of Zadar) part of Croatia (Table 1). The presence of larvae and parasiotids in galls was researched oil the sites in Zagreb. On 9 July 2008 a sample of 20 black locust leaves was taken from 3 trees and analised. Galls (Figure 1) with white (Figure 2) and yellow larvae (Figure 3) were found oil the leaves. White larvae are young and yellow older instars. In the sample of 20 leaves i.e. 251 leaflets of black locust 599 galls were found which is 2,3 galls oil average per leaflet. Total number of larvae was 1183 or 2 larvae oil average per gall, out of which yellow larve (916) were numerous than white (82) (Table 2). Parasitised larve (Figure 4) and cocoons of parasitoid Platygaster robiniae (Figure 5) were found ill galls. The percentage of parasitism of black locust gall midge in the sample was 15,6% (Table 2). The black locust gall midge can be cosidered as a new invasive species in Europe as well as in Croatia. The midge was very probably introduced to Europe with planting material and its main vectors of dispersal in Europe were black locust ornamental plants trade and intensive international vehicle transport. The dispersal in Croatia had two main entries: from Slovenia and Hungary for the continental part and from Italy for the Mediterranean part. The observations of the black locus midge biology in the northwestern Croatia in 2008 have not shown the development of new generation after July. The last larvae in galls were found on 9 July. Our own observations and different data oil overwintering of other researchers have shown a need for more researches of the various aspects of black locust midge biology (number of generations, overwintering). In the galls of the black locust gall midge the parasitised larvae (Figure 4) and cocoons of parasitoid Platygaster robiniae (Figure 5) were found oil all localities of research in Croatia. This is the first record of this species ill Croatia. From the percentage of parasitism of 15,6% it call be presumed that the midge is present in Croatia for several years (which confirms the record from 2006) and that the parasitoid has successfully adapted itself to the new pest. In the next year a more intensive spread of black locust gall midge in Croatia can be expected, but also a multiple rise in parasitism levels. Black locust gall midge makes distinctive damages on leaflets of black locust - galls (Figure 1). Numerous galls oil leaflets influence the assimilation process and can cause premature leaf drop. The galls influence the aestethic value of black locust ornamental plants. The estimation of damages caused by the midge vary considerably in Europaean countries. Black locust is not all important forest species in Croatia so the black locust gall midge is not considered as important forest pests. Aesthetic damages call be expected on ornamental plants.","Title":"BLACK LOCUST GALL MIDGE (Obolodiplosis robiniae), NEW PEST ON BLACK LOCUST TREES AND FIRST RECORD OF PARASITOID Platygaster robinae IN CROATIA"},"content":"Black locust gall midge (Obolodiplosis robiniae) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is the most recent invasive species ill Europe originating, like its host plant, from North America.

The low level of variation within the X. fastidiosa subsp. piercei and X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi clades, despite their antiquity, suggests strong selection, possibly driven by host plant adaptation."},"results":{"annotations":[{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":114,"end":132},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":135,"end":153},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":313,"end":334},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1100,"end":1114},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":287,"end":311},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":250,"end":266},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":340,"end":351},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":355,"end":367},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":369,"end":378},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":384,"end":398},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":548,"end":561},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":687,"end":700},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":787,"end":800},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":851,"end":864},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":821,"end":823},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":833,"end":836},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":883,"end":886},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":888,"end":890},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":892,"end":895},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":906,"end":909},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1010,"end":1023},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1378,"end":1405},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1410,"end":1438},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1501,"end":1531},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1585,"end":1615},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":1709,"end":1712},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":1731,"end":1733},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":1735,"end":1738},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":1744,"end":1747},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1842,"end":1870},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1875,"end":1902}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Abstract":"","Refid":117,"Author":"M.

We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to study this issue in Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca from Brazil, a bacterium causing citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) and coffee leaf scorch (CLS). All 55 citrus isolates typed (plus one coffee isolate) defined three similar sequence types (STs) dominated by ST11 (85%), while the remaining 22 coffee isolates defined two STs, mainly ST16 (74%). This low level of variation masked unusually large allelic differences (>1% divergence with no intermediates) at five loci (leuA, petC, malF, cysG, and holC).

We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to study this issue in Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca from Brazil, a bacterium causing citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) and coffee leaf scorch (CLS). All 55 citrus isolates typed (plus one coffee isolate) defined three similar sequence types (STs) dominated by ST11 (85%), while the remaining 22 coffee isolates defined two STs, mainly ST16 (74%). This low level of variation masked unusually large allelic differences (>1% divergence with no intermediates) at five loci (leuA, petC, malF, cysG, and holC).

Sano and Salvo exhibit >80% nucleotide identity to each other in aligned regions and are syntenic to phage BcepNazgul. We propose that phage BcepNazgul is the founding member of a novel phage type, to which Sano and Salvo belong. The lysis genes of the Nazgul-like phage type include a gene that encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein endolysin and also spanin gene families that provide insight into the evolution of the lysis pathway for phages of Gram-negative hosts. Prado and Paz, although exhibiting no significant DNA homology to each other, are new members of the phiKMV-like phage type, based on the position of the single-subunit RNA polymerase gene. The four phages are type IV pilus dependent for infection of both X. fastidiosa and Xanthomonas. The phages may be useful as agents for an effective and environmentally responsible strategy for the control of diseases caused by X. fastidiosa.","Refid":228,"Author":"S. J. Ahern, M. Das, T. S.

We report the isolation and characterization of the first virulent phages for X. fastidiosa, siphophages Sano and Salvo and podophages Prado and Paz, with a host range that includes Xanthomonas spp. Phages propagated on homologous hosts had observed adsorption rate constants of similar to 4 x 10(-12) ml cell(-1) min(-1) for X. fastidiosa strain Temecula 1 and similar to 5 x 10(-10) to 7 x 10(-10) ml cell(-1) min(-1) for Xanthomonas strain EC-12. Sano and Salvo exhibit >80% nucleotide identity to each other in aligned regions and are syntenic to phage BcepNazgul. We propose that phage BcepNazgul is the founding member of a novel phage type, to which Sano and Salvo belong. The lysis genes of the Nazgul-like phage type include a gene that encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein endolysin and also spanin gene families that provide insight into the evolution of the lysis pathway for phages of Gram-negative hosts. Prado and Paz, although exhibiting no significant DNA homology to each other, are new members of the phiKMV-like phage type, based on the position of the single-subunit RNA polymerase gene. The four phages are type IV pilus dependent for infection of both X. fastidiosa and Xanthomonas. The phages may be useful as agents for an effective and environmentally responsible strategy for the control of diseases caused by X. fastidiosa."},"results":{"annotations":[{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1603,"end":1616},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":243,"end":263},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":127,"end":145},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1441,"end":1454},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":226,"end":231},{"tag":"Plant_species","start":236,"end":242},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":62,"end":80},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":591,"end":604},{"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":206,"end":222},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":343,"end":356},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":85,"end":96},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1459,"end":1470},{"tag":"Plant_pest","start":447,"end":463}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"metadata":{"Abstract":"","Refid":200,"Author":"R.

No outstanding level of resistance to infection was detected among the seven rootstocks tested. The rootstocks from 'Curtis', 'Elliott', and 'Riverside' were less susceptible than one standard rootstock in the test ('VC1-68') and less susceptible than highly susceptible 'Cape Fear' rootstock. Conversely, the rootstocks from 'Apache', 'Moore', 'Stuart', and 'VC1-68' seed had a level of susceptibility to infection comparable to 'Cape Fear' and perhaps are not the best choice for rootstocks in geographic areas where X. fastidiosa is prevalent. The results of this research suggest that there is variation in rootstock susceptibility to infection by X fastidiosa. The use of mechanical inoculation may facilitate identification of susceptibility categories of pecan rootstocks to the pecan bacterial leaf scorch pathogen."}},"results":{"annotations":[{"end":2026,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":2015},{"end":396,"tag":"Plant_species","start":390},{"end":290,"tag":"Plant_species","start":284},{"end":1877,"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1865},{"end":1981,"tag":"Plant_species","start":1975},{"end":934,"tag":"Plant_species","start":928},{"end":914,"tag":"Plant_species","start":908},{"end":635,"tag":"Plant_species","start":629},{"end":2005,"tag":"Plant_species","start":1999},{"end":130,"tag":"Plant_species","start":84},{"end":36,"tag":"Plant_species","start":30},{"end":1745,"tag":"Plant_pest","start":1732},{"end":538,"tag":"Plant_disease_commname","start":527},{"end":81,"tag":"Plant_pest","start":63},{"end":753,"tag":"Plant_pest","start":740},{"end":493,"tag":"Plant_pest","start":475}],"classifications":[]}},{"example":{"content":"Susceptibility to Xylella fastidiosa in a First-generation Hybrid from a non-traditional Peach-Almond Cross | To facilitate development of Prunus L. rootstocks with desirable agronomic traits, domesticated peach (Prunus persica) and almond (P. dulcis) were crossed with wild almond relatives.

The disease was recently found in Central America and is threatening the multi-billion U.S. citrus industry. Many strains of X. fastidiosa are pathogens or endophytes in various plants growing in the U.S., and some strains cross infect several host plants. In this study, a TaqMan-based assay targeting the 16S rDNA signature region was developed for the identification of X. fastidiosa at the species level. Another TagMan-based assay was developed for the specific identification of the CVC strains. Both new assays have been systematically validated in comparison with the primer/probe sets from four previous.ly published assays on one platform and under similar PCR conditions, and shown to be superior. The species specific assay detected all X. fastidiosa strains and did not amplify any other citrus pathogen or endophyte tested. The CVC-specific assay detected all CVC strains but did not amplify any non-CVC X. fastidiosa nor any other citrus pathogen or endophyte evaluated. Both sets were multiplexed with a reliable internal control assay targeting host plant DNA, and their diagnostic specificity and sensitivity remained unchanged.

The disease was recently found in Central America and is threatening the multi-billion U.S. citrus industry. Many strains of X. fastidiosa are pathogens or endophytes in various plants growing in the U.S., and some strains cross infect several host plants. In this study, a TaqMan-based assay targeting the 16S rDNA signature region was developed for the identification of X. fastidiosa at the species level. Another TagMan-based assay was developed for the specific identification of the CVC strains. Both new assays have been systematically validated in comparison with the primer/probe sets from four previous.ly published assays on one platform and under similar PCR conditions, and shown to be superior. The species specific assay detected all X. fastidiosa strains and did not amplify any other citrus pathogen or endophyte tested. The CVC-specific assay detected all CVC strains but did not amplify any non-CVC X. fastidiosa nor any other citrus pathogen or endophyte evaluated. Both sets were multiplexed with a reliable internal control assay targeting host plant DNA, and their diagnostic specificity and sensitivity remained unchanged. This internal control provides quality assurance for DNA extraction, performance of PCR reagents, platforms and operators. The limit of detection for both assays was equivalent to 2 to 10 cells of X. fastidiosa per reaction for field citrus samples. Petioles and midribs of symptomatic leaves of sweet orange harbored the highest populations of X. fastidiosa, providing the best materials for detection of the pathogen.

The frequency of attachment of X. fastidiosa to xylem vessels was 20-fold lower in the presence of OMVs than in their absence. OMV production thus is a strategy used by X. fastidiosa cells to adjust attachment to surfaces in its transition from adhesive cells capable of insect transmission to an \"exploratory\" lifestyle for systemic spread within the plant host which would be hindered by attachment.
